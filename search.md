This site doesn't have any kind of database, so a fully featured search engine is difficult without including some JavaScript.

However, [Javascript isn't always bad](/is-javascript-bad-well-only-if-youre-using-it-wrong/), so I decided to implement it. You can use the form below to search this site in real time:

{% include search-form.html %}
