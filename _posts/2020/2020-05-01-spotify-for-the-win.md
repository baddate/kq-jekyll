    I am every now and then thinking about switching back to MP3s. I don’t listen to music that often and when I buy an MP3 once, I can listen to it infinitely often and don’t have to pay every month. But I got so used to Spotify recommending me music that I like, that now I don’t even have an idea what artists the music is from.

I wanted to quickly reply to Jan-Lukas&#8217; post about using Spotify vs having a local music library. I&#8217;ve been a Spotify premium user for a few years now and I **love** their service. I pay £14.99/month for a [family account](https://www.spotify.com/uk/family/), which allows for up to 6 premium accounts in the same household.

The added value of automated playlists based on what you have been listening to, and the fact that the music on offer is so vast, Spotify is a no-brainer for me.

I think £14.99/month is a very small price to pay. I know Spotify is proprietary software, but this very much comes under the [pragmatism](https://kevquirk.com/why-i-use-linux/) umbrella for me.

The alternative of manually maintaining a music library, then having to either copy it over to all my devices, or maintaining a self-hosted solution to stream it, is too much hassle. I&#8217;d much rather pay Spotify to do all that for me. I install the app, login and away I go. Simple.

If Spotify were to double their prices tomorrow, I think it would still be a good deal. _Please don&#8217;t do that, Spotify!_
