I was [posting my usual drivel on Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@kev) yesterday, when I came up with an idea. The idea was fleeting, and I gave it absolutely no thought whatsoever. Honestly, I didn't think it would get any responses. Here's the toot:

It's all pretty self-explanatory really. The hashtag `#100DaysOfCode` is pretty popular, but I thought there may be something similar for people who write on a personal website, like me.

What if we had a hashtag that encourages both existing and new bloggers to start writing? The posts don't need to be long-form, technical masterpieces that should earn you a masters in English. But instead, just a simple and fun way to get people writing and sharing their thoughts. You never know, the whole might be cathartic too.

So I came up with the idea of `#100DaysToOffload`. Post every day for 100 days. Get your thoughts out there. Rant, share your knowledge, share pictures of your pets, share your experiences. **Just. Write.**

## Let's Share {#h-let-s-share}

Off the back of the extremely positive response I've had from the Fediverse, I decided there could be something to this. So I've setup a new website - <https://100daystooffload.com>.

This site allows people who are taking part to get more information about the challenge, as well as find links to the `#100DaysToOffload` hashtag feed for various sites.

This should allow people who are either taking part, or just intersted in the challenge, to find content from the various people taking part. I may later add a kind of blogroll for people who are taking part, but that could be a lot of work.

## My 100 Days {#h-my-100-days}

This post marks the start of my personal run through `#100DaysToOffload`. Consider this post number 1 of 100. I don't know if I will complete the challenge, but it will be fun trying. Even if I miss the odd day here and there, it's not the end of the world.

If you want to get more information about `#100DaysToOffload`, take a look at [the home page](https://100daystooffload.com) on the new site. This should give you an idea of what I think the challenge looks like, but feel free to make it your own.

#### Good luck! {#h-good-luck}
