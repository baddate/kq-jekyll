There&#8217;s an old saying in tech circles, which goes something along the lines of:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large">
  <p>
    On the Internet, if a product is free, you&#8217;re the product.
  </p>
</blockquote>

I recently [switched from WordPress to Jekyll](/goodbye-wordpress-switched-to-jekyll/) and hosting is now provided by the free tier of Netlify. It&#8217;s a great service that automatically builds and deploys my site whenever I do a `git push`.

I can&#8217;t help but think about the quote above though &#8211; am I the product here? Should I be paying for my static site hosting? Netlify offer a pro tier, but it&#8217;s $19/month, which is more than I&#8217;d care to pay for hosting.

Maybe I should consider another hosting provider, like [AWS Amplify](https://console.amplify.aws/), [Digital Ocean&#8217;s App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/) or <del>God forbid</del> the [newly announced](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-pages/) Cloudflare pages.

I still have my trusty VPS with Ionos (albeit recently migrated from CentOS to Ubuntu, because, you know, [reasons](https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/)). Maybe I could come up with a way of automatically deploying my site from Git using my VPS &#8211; Plesk already has Git integration, so maybe it would be trivial.

**I should look into that.**

What do you think, dear reader? By using Netlify&#8217;s free hosting tier, am I the product here?
