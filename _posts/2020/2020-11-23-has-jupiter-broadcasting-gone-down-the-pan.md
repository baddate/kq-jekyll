I feel like Jupiter Broadcasting (<a href="https://jupiterbroadcasting.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">link</a>) have gone down the pan recently. The quality of the content they&#8217;re producing hasn&#8217;t gone down as such. Well, except for the fact that _User Error_ & _Choose Linux_ have gone. What I&#8217;m getting at here is the obnoxious amount of adverts that JB embed into their shows now they have divorced A Cloud Guru.

For example, I just listened to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/143452/linux-action-news-164/" target="_blank">the latest Linux Action News</a>, which is 29 minutes long. That episode includes two adverts. The first is for Linode, which is 3 minutes long (09:00 &#8211; 12:05), and the other for Ting which is 2 minutes long (20:35 &#8211; 22:35).

<p class="tldr">
  That&#8217;s 5 minutes of adverts in a 29 minute show!
</p>

It feels like the same kind of ratio for Linux Unplugged too. I have no idea what it&#8217;s like on Self Hosted, as I stopped listening to that show when it became clear that it&#8217;s a show about home automation, **not** self hosting.

## Other revenue streams? {#h-other-revenue-streams}

The Jupiter Broadcasting folks have this core contributor thing which is $8/month and you get an &#8220;advert free&#8221; RSS feed for Linux Unplugged. I actually subscribed to that when they first announced it, but revoked my support after the first month.

**That&#8217;s because it isn&#8217;t an advert free feed.** The episodes still include adverts for A Cloud Guru. Also, if you want to get rid of the adverts from the other shows, good luck &#8211; the $8/month only covers you for Linux Unplugged.

Look, I get it. Chris and the team need to make a living, but I feel like ramming advert after advert down our throats and giving us no way to remove them isn&#8217;t the best way of doing this.

[I&#8217;m happy to show support with my wallet](https://kevquirk.com/about/#contributions), but I refuse to pay for something that I fell is mis-sold snake oil. I&#8217;d much rather sign up for something like a $10/month Patreon tier where Patrons get access to **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">all shows</span>** with a **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">REAL</span>** advert free feed.

## Conclusion {#h-conclusion}

I&#8217;ll end by summing up my position, as this post is a ranty mess:

  * The &#8220;advert free&#8221; feeds that listeners pay for aren&#8217;t actually advert free.
  * Jupiter Broadcasting have removed some of the best shows they had from their line up. Namely User Error and Choose Linux.
  * They appear to have added much longer adverts to their shows since diverging from A Cloud Guru.

**What do you think? Am I being too harsh?**
