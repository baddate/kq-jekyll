So I&#8217;m at my desk, <s>playing 0 A.D.</s> working away, and my lovely wife brings me a cup of tea. As she came into the study she said _&#8220;Blimey! Do you have enough devices there?&#8221;_

I was on my desktop, and all I had next to me was my personal and work phones &#8211; not that many devices, I thought. But that did get me thinking; how many devices is too many?

Here&#8217;s a list of the devices I have and use on a regular basis (most days):

  * Personal laptop (X1 Carbon)
  * Work laptop (HP Elitebook)
  * Wife&#8217;s laptop (HP Probook)
  * Desktop (self-built)
  * [Synology NAS](https://kevquirk.com/moving-from-nextcloud-to-synology/)/server
  * Work phone (Samsung S9)
  * Personal phone (2020 iPhone SE)
  * iPad Air 3
  * Kobo Aura One

#### That&#8217;s too many devices! {#h-that-s-too-many-devices}

Having thought about it, I think that&#8217;s too many devices. Who really needs that many?

I _could_ use my iPad to read eBooks instead of my Kobo.

Work calls could be forwarded to my personal phone.

Do my wife and I need our own laptops?

Do I need a desktop as well as a laptop?

There&#8217;s a lot I could to do reduce the number of devices I have/use. But the fact of the matter is, I don&#8217;t want to. I&#8217;m very fortunate to be able to afford all of this stuff, and I love technology, so why not?

**How many devices do you have?** I&#8217;d love to hear if my list is within the bounds of normality. I _think_ it is; for techies at least, but it would be nice to know for sure.
