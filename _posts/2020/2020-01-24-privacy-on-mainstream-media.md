I’ve just been having a flick through Hacker News and I came across this post from the BBC:

{: .medium}
<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="What can you use instead of Google and Facebook? (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50460712" target="_blank">What can you use instead of Google and Facebook?</a>

It’s an interesting read that talks about things that many privacy advocates already know &#8211; namely <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="DuckDuckGo (opens in a new tab)" href="https://duckduckgo.com" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a> instead of Google and <a href="https://signal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Signal (opens in a new tab)">Signal</a> instead of WhatsApp.

However, many people outside of the privacy niche don’t know about these services, and they will only ever find out if mainstream news outlets, like the BBC, keep producing content like this.

I was so happy to see this on the BBC, I had to share it.
