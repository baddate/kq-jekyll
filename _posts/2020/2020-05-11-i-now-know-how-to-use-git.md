**A few days ago I wrote about how [I have no idea how Git works](https://kevquirk.com/confession-i-have-no-idea-how-to-use-git/).** **Since then, things have changed and I&#8217;m now basking in the warm orange glow of Git repositories.**

## What happened next? {#h-what-happened-next}

After publishing the post about not being able to use Git, I re-posted it to Fosstodon (I&#8217;m all about the [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) these days). I was half expecting some outrage and honest feedback about how I&#8217;m clearly an idiot.

**That wasn&#8217;t the case.**

Instead I got numerous responses to help me learn, both on Fosstodon and via email. The community response was amazing and inspiring.

I decided that if the community can come to my aid and offer to help me learn, the least I should is get off my lazy fat arse and actually give learning Git a proper go.

**That&#8217;s what I did.**

## Learning Git {#h-learning-git}

[Ivan Tomica](https://www.tomica.net/) sent me a link to [this brilliant website](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) that reduces learning Git to simple, bite-sized pieces.

After 30 minutes I had successfully carried out my first `commit` and `push` from the Git CLI. I have to say, once the basics had clicked into place for me, the whole thing became much simpler to follow.

I&#8217;ve since been able to configure my local repositories to authenticate to GitHub using SSH keys. I&#8217;ve even been able to create a webhook that forces my web server to instigate an automatic pull (also via SSH) whenever one of my repositories are updated.

This means I can code changes to my theme or websites, do a `git push` and my they are auotmagically updated. No messing around with FTP.

**Why didn&#8217;t I do this sooner?**

## Conclusion {#h-conclusion}

In [my disclaimer](https://kevquirk.com/disclaimer/) I say the following:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    My thoughts and opinions change from time to time; I consider this a necessary consequence of having an open mind.
  </p>
</blockquote>

This is _definitely_ one of those occasions. Over the last few days my opinion of Git has done a full 180, and I&#8217;m now looking at other cool things that can be done with it.

**I&#8217;m even exploring [static site generators](https://kevquirk.com/why-i-dont-use-a-static-site-generator/)!**
