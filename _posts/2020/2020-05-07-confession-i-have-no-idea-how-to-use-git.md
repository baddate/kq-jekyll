**I have a confession to make &#8211; _I have no idea how to use Git._** **Pull requests, commits, branches (what the hell do trees have to do with it?) It&#8217;s all jargon to me!**

So I have a [Github account](https://github.com/kevquirk), I even have a handful of repositories on there. However, I have absolutely no idea what I&#8217;m doing. If I want to add some source code to a repo, I upload it via the web GUI and that&#8217;s it.

## The Git Nightmare {#h-the-git-nightmare}

I think that Git is another one of those tools that&#8217;s been made by extremely clever people, but introduces a barrier for entry.

Why can&#8217;t I just have a method by which I edit some code, click a button, and any new files are uploaded to the repository? What&#8217;s with all the staging and committing? It&#8217;s so bloody confusing.

With Git being so convoluted to get going with, I&#8217;ve found it almost impossible to learn every time I&#8217;ve tried. Now I know I&#8217;m not the sharpest tool in the box, but Git is just a black hole of confusion to me.

## What Am I Missing? {#h-what-am-i-missing}

Is there something obvious I&#8217;m missing? I see lots people doing all sorts of clever stuff with Github, and I&#8217;d love to get involved, but I just can&#8217;t get over that initial stumbling block of connecting all the dots and terminologies together.

Are there any resources available **for people who are NOT seasoned software developers** to learn Git?

I&#8217;m pretty lost here, folks.
