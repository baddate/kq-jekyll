  I wanted to register <code>quirk.uk</code>, but arsehole domain squatters are getting in the way and making that almost impossible.

  <strong>WARNING &#8211; this post contains swearing as I&#8217;m pissed off.</strong>
</p>

I have to confess, I love a good domain name and the shorter the better. For example, I own `kevquirk.com` but prefer `kevq.uk` for this website as it&#8217;s nice and short.

<a href="https://kevq.uk/why-you-should-own-your-own-domain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Owning your own domain name is very important</a> and while `kevq.uk` is a good domain name, I want something that only uses my surname. So I can have `kev@quirk.[tld]` as an email address. This is then also good for other members of my family.

I already own `quirk.cc` <a href="https://kevq.uk/identities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and a number of other domains</a>, but I&#8217;m not thrilled with the `.cc` TLD. So I went looking for something better&#8230;

## Domain squatters are scum {#h-domain-squatters-are-scum}

I found that <a href="https://quirk.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quirk.uk</a> had already been registered, but was available for purchase. A `.uk` domain name costs around £8 ($10) **per year** to register. So I made an offer that I thought was more than fair &#8211; £100 (~$135).

Around 20 minutes later I get an email back to say my offer has been rejected. I went back and asked what they would accept and **the domain squatters came back with a counter offer of £750 (~$1000).**

**Seven hundred and fifty pounds!**

That doesn&#8217;t include VAT either, which is 20% here in the UK. Since then, the domain landing page had been updated with a slightly discounted price of £659 (~$880). Oh how kind!

## Are you for real? {#h-are-you-for-real}

If it isn&#8217;t obvious from this site, my name is Kev Quirk. It&#8217;s my personal name, and I wanted to use that domain for personal email hosting. That&#8217;s why I wanted the `.uk` and not the `.co.uk` domain. I&#8217;m not a company, so I have no way to financially gain from purchasing this domain.

<p class="has-white-color has-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background">
  Seriously, if you&#8217;re one of these domain squatters who makes their living this way, <strong>FUCK YOU!</strong>
</p>

I&#8217;d like to say an extra special, giant, FUCK YOU to <a href="http://www.nva-online.nl/portfolio.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVA Online Advertising B.V.</a> who have the audacity to rip off consumers like me all over the world. Fuckers.

I really wish there was a way for people like me, just Joe or Jane Bloggs off the street, to fight back against these wankers. If I can prove my name contains `Quirk` and I have no financial incentive, should that give me some rights to own the domain? I think so.

If it was being used legitimately, I&#8217;d have absolutely not problem with someone else owning the domain. But domain squatters are in it purely for profit and they really are the scum of the earth as far as I&#8217;m concerned.

## Conclusion {#h-conclusion}

I&#8217;m stuck with `quirk.cc`. It&#8217;s not the end of the world, and I realise this is very much a first world problem. But still, it&#8217;s shitty that all these fuckers are free to get away with this stuff.

If you know a way in which I can fight back to try and own this domain, more for a moral victory than anything else, please do <a href="https://kevq.uk/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get in touch</a>.

Until then, I&#8217;ll climb back under my rock&#8230;
