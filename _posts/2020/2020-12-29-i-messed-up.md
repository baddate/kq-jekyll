Picture the scene &#8211; I’m at my computer, working away and having fun messing around with some web dev stuff. I do this kind of thing all the time; it’s fun and [web design is a hobby of mine](/category/web-design).

This time around I was playing with the new [Twenty Twenty-One](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyone/) theme by WordPress. It looks like a great theme &#8211; simple, clean and really good looking. So I wanted to take it for a spin.

Usually when I’m faffing around with this kind of stuff, I do it on a private sub-domain that only I can access. Today was no different…or so I thought. You see dear reader, I somehow managed to change the DNS record for my apex domain, instead of the sub-domain I was faffing around with.

This resulted in me **replacing** my live AWS Amplify hosted [Jekyll website](/goodbye-wordpress-switched-to-jekyll/) with the WP site I was pissing about with.

## The fallout {#h-the-fallout}

I’ve already had a couple of people ping me asking why the hell I was pissing about with my website again, after promising to leave the bloody thing alone. Someone else also said that [my RSS feeds](/rss-feeds) have shit the bed again and spammed their reader.

**EVERYTHING IS BACK TO NORMAL NOW!** I’m really sorry if I caused you any hassle, all the RSS feeds are right again now and should self-correct, so don’t worry if you haven’t checked in the last few hours, you won’t get spammed (I hope).

## Preventing a reoccurrence {#h-preventing-a-reoccurrence}

I’ve already registered a playground domain that I will use for all my forms of web dev faffery, so this _shouldn’t_ happen again (never say never). Once again, I’m really sorry if you were impacted by my ridiculous tomfoolery!

Normal service has resumed…promise! ?‍♂️
