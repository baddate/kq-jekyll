Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve had to remove the Mastodon Webmention integration into this site.

A few days ago, I wrote about how [I've added some IndieWeb goodness to this site](/implementing-the-indieweb-into-my-website/), which includes [Webmention](https://indieweb.org/webmention). I tend to post links to a lot of the posts I publish on [Mastodon](https://fosttodon.org/@kev).

So, when people comment, like or boost my posts, I get a Webmention. This is great in theory, but I have nearly 10,000 followers on Mastodon. Because of this, my posts tend to get quite a lot of likes, boosts and comments.

This is a great problem to have, and I love the community on Mastodon. But [I got rid of comments](/removing-comments/) to get away from admin that they require. With each like and boost coming through as a separate comment, it's too much.

I may bring it back in future, once I've matured the integration of Webmention into the site a little better, but until then I'll be keeping the Mastodon integration turned off.

I was using [Brid.gy](https://brid.gy/) for this integration - I'd highly recommend their service if you want to integrate Webmention from other sites.

Normal Webmentions for other members of the IndieWeb will continue to work as normal.
