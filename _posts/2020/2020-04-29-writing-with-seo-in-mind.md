I read this post on Desmond&#8217;s blog yesterday (great blog, you should definitely subscribe. Especially if you&#8217;re into the IndieWeb). In the post, Desmond talks about how growing his audience and [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) are not priorities for him. He says:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    In a rough sense, I know what it would take to garner more readers to my blog (better attention to SEO, targeted subject matter). But I also know that if I took that too far, this blog would cease to be about me, and I don&#8217;t think I want that to happen.
  </p>
</blockquote>

With regards to growing a readership, I completely agree. Personally, I think if you have started a personal blog with the intention of growing a huge following and becoming _Internet famous,&nbsp;_you&#8217;re probably doing it for the wrong reasons.

## But SEO&#8230; {#h-but-seo}

SEO is another matter. I think it&#8217;s important to follow good SEO hygiene where possible. I use the [Yoast plugin](https://nl.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) to help with my SEO, but I only really do that for long-form posts where I&#8217;m talking about a specific topic. That usually means my technical articles, or how-to guides.

Things like this post &#8211; notes and IndieWeb replies &#8211; I tend to not include any SEO keywords. I&#8217;m writing a down my thoughts &#8211; there&#8217;s no SEO for that. I just try to ensure the readability is good, as my thoughts aren&#8217;t usually that coherent. ðŸ™‚

So I do see where Desmond is coming from in some respects, but a little bit of SEO can be a good thing for the right post(s). On this blog, I _could_ certainly do a lot more with SEO, but I think that would take some of the fun out of blogging, and stop me writing the way I want.

The more I think about it, the more I see where Desmond is coming from. I obviously don&#8217;t know how much SEO work Desmond does, if any. But it is important to strike a balance between SEO taking over your blog so you can grow it, and making sure you remain you. After all, these are personal blogs we&#8217;re talking about.
