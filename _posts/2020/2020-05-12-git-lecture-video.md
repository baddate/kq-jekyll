Someone on Twitter shared this video with me. It&#8217;s an MIT lecture from February 2020 that details the fundamentals of Git. The nice thing about this lecture, is that it doesn&#8217;t just talk about useful commands and using Git, but also the underlying makeup of Git.

As someone who is relatively new to Git, this was incredibly useful in putting the component parts of Git together, which really helped my understanding of the tool.

If you want to learn Git, this lecture is a great place to start.
