This was an interesting post by Jan-Lukas, and some of the comments on Hacker News were very interesting (he mentions specifics in his post, but you can [read them all here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22910532)). I thought I would turn this on its head an answer _why I have a blog_.

My blog is a place where I can share my own thoughts, feelings and experiences in a space where I have total control over the message and its content. Where possible, I try to utilise the IndieWeb mentality of [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) (Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere).

#### Why do you blog (or not)? {#h-why-do-you-blog-or-not}

I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts, preferably by way of reply on your own, IndieWeb enabled blog. ðŸ™‚
