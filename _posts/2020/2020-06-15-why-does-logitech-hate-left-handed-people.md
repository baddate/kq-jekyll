I&#8217;ve recently been looking at switching my traditional mouse for a trackball mouse. I asked for recommendations on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org) and the overwhelming recommendation was the [Logitech M570](https://amzn.to/3hueW6x). Unfortunately, Logitech don&#8217;t make a left handed version, and after a bit of research it seems that the issue goes much further than just this device.

Now, many standard mice can be used with either hand as they&#8217;re symmetrical. But if you want to use an ergonomic mouse, be it trackball or traditional, these are specific to one hand or another.

The problem with Logitech is that they don&#8217;t make _any_ left handed mice, in any of their ranges. So although my initial search was for a trackball, this covers all mice they produce. For example, [this one](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/mx-master-business?crid=7).

  <strong>Update May 2021: </strong>Since writing this post, I bought <a href="https://amzn.to/3d7j6QY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>this left-handed ergonomic mouse</strong></a>. I&#8217;ve been using it for nearly a year now and I&#8217;m VERY happy with it.

## Why Logitech hates left handed people {#h-why-logitech-hates-left-handed-people}

If you take a look around the [Logitech forums](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/search#q=left%20handed&s=all&p=9), you will see 279 pages of search results from people complaining about the lack of left handed support from Logitech.

**There are posts going back years**; some have responses from Logitech team members, others have just been ignored. The problem is, every post I&#8217;ve seen has had the same regurgitation of a cookie cutter response.

Posts like [this one from 9 months ago](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360034826514-MX-Master-3-Still-no-Left-Handed-Model-) where the poster is requesting a left handed mouse, gets the following response from Logitech:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    The left handed version the MX Master 3 is not yet available and we do not have any information on when a left handed version would be available.
  </p>

  <p>
    I&#8217;ll have this post forwarded to the proper team here on my end&#8230;
  </p>

In another post, [also from 9 months ago](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360035820194-MX-MASTER-3-for-left-handed), Logitech reply **4 months later** with the following:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    Thank you for reaching Logitech! We deeply apologize for not providing a prompt response.
  </p>

  <p>
    As with your inquiry about the MX Master 3, the manufactured device at the moment are intended for people who use their mouse using their right hand.[&#8230;] We will forward this post to our team for consideration.
  </p>

There&#8217;s also [this post](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360038254493-Left-handed-MX-mice) from 5 months ago, [this post](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360032456014-Left-handed) from 2 years ago and [this post](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360032235714-left-handed-mouse) from **3 years ago**. And that&#8217;s just in the first 3 of those 279 pages of results!

The forums are littered with posts from fellow lefties pleading with Logitech to create a left handed mouse. But many years later, we&#8217;re still _left_ out in the cold.

## Discrimination? {#h-discrimination}

According to Wikipedia, [around 10% of the world&#8217;s population are left handed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness). Ten percent may not sound like a lot, but that&#8217;s the equivalent population of the USA, Japan, Brazil & Germany **combined**. That&#8217;s a lot of people!

On their website, Logitech say the following about their [MX Ergo trackball](https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/product/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse) mouse:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    Logitech&#8217;s most advanced trackball for trackball enthusiasts and consumers searching for alternatives to mice and touchpads. Delivers 20% less muscular strain compared to a regular mouse.
  </p>

  <cite>Logitech</cite>

So does the muscular strain of left handed people not matter to you, Logitech? I suppose those **780 million** left handed people worldwide don&#8217;t really matter, hey?

I&#8217;d like to finally add that the title of this post is facetious. I know that Logitech don&#8217;t _hate_ left handed people. It&#8217;s ok Logitech, I still really like your hardware, but it would be wonderful if you offered some ergonomic mice for left handed people. ðŸ™‚
