I really hate it when I visit a blog to read a post, only to find that the owner hasn&#8217;t bothered to add a published date to their posts.

Is the post a week old? A month old? 5 years old? We have absolutely no idea as consumers of your content.

This is particularly important when it comes to anything that is time sensitive, like technical posts. Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m looking to install an obscure package that isn&#8217;t in the Ubuntu repo. I find a guide on how to do it, but if there&#8217;s no date I could be installing a version that&#8217;s 5 years old that potentially contains serious vulnerabilities.

For goodness sake, add the bloody published date to your posts! Its not difficult.
