I recently discovered [Jan-Lukas Else&#8217;s blog](https://jlelse.blog), which contains a tonne of great posts &#8211; I&#8217;d strongly recommend checking out his blog if you&#8217;re a techie.

While I was perusing Jan&#8217;s blog, I came across [his blogroll](https://jlelse.blog/blogroll), which includes links to other blogs he finds interesting. Again, that list is well worth checking out as it has some good blogs in there.

_Side note &#8211; I was thrilled to see this blog listed on his list, thanks Jan! ðŸ™‚_

I went through the list, hoping to find some new feeds to add to my RSS reader. But I was surprised to learn that many of the blogs that Jan had linked to didn&#8217;t support RSS.

## Y U No RSS? {#h-y-u-no-rss}

I was able to find some of these people on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org), so I will be able to consume their new content. However, some people had no obvious way to subscribe, so I will be unlikely to see their new posts in future.

There aren&#8217;t many tech people that I know who don&#8217;t use RSS feeds to consume news and articles, so by not supporting RSS you could be losing readers. I know for most people (myself included) writing content isn&#8217;t about amassing a huge readership, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we shouldn&#8217;t take steps to ensure our content is easy to consume.

#### If you own a blog, please make sure it supports RSS. {#h-if-you-own-a-blog-please-make-sure-it-supports-rss}

Oh, that reminds me, if you want to add the feed for this site to your RSS reader, it&#8217;s [https://kevq.uk/feed](/feed).

**Can you think of a good reason NOT to use RSS on a website? What am I missing here?**
