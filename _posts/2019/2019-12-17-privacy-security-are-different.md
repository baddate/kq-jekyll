I regularly see people using the terms _Privacy_ and _Security_ interchangably online. I wanted to take a couple of minutes to explain the differences between the two.

I hear statements like the one below more often than I&#8217;d care to remember:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    I always use a VPN when I&#8217;m surfing the net so I can protect my privacy. You can never be too careful these days!
  </p>
</blockquote>

That&#8217;s absolutely right, you can&#8217;t be too careful, but by using a VPN you&#8217;re not protecting your _Privacy_, you&#8217;re improving your _Security._

## What is Privacy? {#h-what-is-privacy}

Maybe a good place to start is the dictionary definition of what privacy is:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    Someone&#8217;s right to keep their personal matters and relationships secret.
  </p>

  <cite><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/privacy">Cambridge Dictionary</a></cite>
</blockquote>

So let&#8217;s dig into this a little further and look at a couple of types of privacy. Maybe these examples will help bolster what privacy actually is:

  * **Physical Privacy** – being free from unwanted/unwarranted touching or restriction of movement.
  * **Data Privacy** – transparency, responsible handling and control in relation to information about people.
  * **Social** **Privacy** – being able to associate with whomever you wish.

## What is Security? {#h-what-is-security}

Again, let&#8217;s look at the dictionary definition of what security is:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    Protection of a person, building, organization, or country against threats such as crime or attacks by a third party.
  </p>

  <cite><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/security">Cambridge Dictionary</a></cite>
</blockquote>

Just like privacy, there are a number of types of security:

  * **Physical Security** – the integrity of a person or premises.
  * **Information Security** – the [CIA triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_triad) model that relates to information and supporting systems.
  * **National Security** – the integrity of borders and infrastructure, often closely entangled with physical and economic security. Depending on the nation, there may also be a social and cultural element to how security is viewed.
  * **Economic Security** – the integrity and availability of trade and financial matters.

So if we use the VPN example from above, we all know that a VPN provides end-to-end encrpytion of data between two points. So if you&#8217;re on a public wi-fi network, the use of a VPN will _secure_ the data you&#8217;re transmitting over that network.

<img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="600" src="/assets/images/wp-images/2019/12/vpn-connection.png" alt="" class="wp-image-559" srcset="/assets/images/wp-images/2019/12/vpn-connection.png 1000w, /assets/images/wp-images/2019/12/vpn-connection-300x180.png 300w, /assets/images/wp-images/2019/12/vpn-connection-768x461.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />  

Now, you could argue that by securing the data you&#8217;re transmitting with a VPN, you&#8217;re also making it more private. That isn&#8217;t the case because the VPN needs to terminate somewhere, so you&#8217;re still trusting the VPN provider to keep your data private.

So by using a VPN, you&#8217;re ensuring that your data is secured during transmission over a particular network, but once that VPN terminates, it&#8217;s just like any other data that is traversing the Internet and your privacy is not protected.

## Conclusion {#h-conclusion}

The TL;DR is if you&#8217;re talking about personal data and keeping it a secret, then that&#8217;s _**Privacy**_. If you&#8217;re talking about protecting your data, that&#8217;s _**Security**_.

Hopefully this quick post articulates the differences between _Privacy_ & _Security_. So the next time you&#8217;re referring to your data and either securing it, or keeping it private, you know which of these two distinctly different process you&#8217;re referring to.
