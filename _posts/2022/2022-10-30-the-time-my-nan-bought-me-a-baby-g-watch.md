Back in the 1990’s I wanted a G-Shock watch, so my nan bought me one for Christmas. Here’s the story of what happened to that watch…

So cast your mind back to the late 90s. I was in high school, *[Saved By The Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saved_by_the_Bell)* was all the rage, and 13 year old Kev desperately wanted a G-Shock watch.

This was because my good friend, Cockney Chris (he was from Milton Keynes and moved to the north…that made him a [cockney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockney) to us), had a G-Shock. I remember Chris’ G-Shock being MASSIVE and really cool. I was so jealous.

Then, one day when we were getting changed in the gym for PE (physical education), and he dropped a bombshell…

> Did you know that this watch is shock proof? I can throw it on the floor as hard as I can and it will still work.
> 
> <cite>Cockney Chris</cite>

We all scoffed and told him he was talking bullshit. *You’re a dreamer, Chris!* We all screamed. *Prove it!*

So he did. He took his watch off, and threw it on the floor as hard as he could. There were a few scuffs on the case, but the watch was still working perfectly.

We. Were. Astounded!

## I need a G-Shock!

That night, I went home and told my mum all about it. I wouldn’t shut up about this bloody watch. I went on, and on, and on about it, by all accounts.

Problem is, G-Shock watches aren’t cheap and I didn’t grow up in a particularly affluent family. My mum was (and still is) a cleaner and my stepdad was a road worker. They simply didn’t have the nearly £100 to waste on a watch for me.

And, let’s be honest, the first thing I was going to do was throw it on the floor to test it’s shock-proofness!

Fast-forward to Christmas; I was opening my gifts and there, twinkling away at me, was a beautiful red and black Baby-G watch from my nan.

I couldn’t believe it! My very own G-Shock! Okay, it was a Baby-G, but that was fine. Plus, it looked much better than a full-size G-Shock on my skinny teenage wrist.

## Back to school

Christmas comes and goes, and I head back to school, proud as punch sporting my fancy new Baby-G watch. I was the talk the of the class! Okay, I wasn’t the talk of the class – no-one really cared – but I *felt* like I was the talk of the class.

Little did I know that I soon would be the talk of the class, and actually, the entire school.

First day back and we’re on break, out on the yard. My friends and I get talking about my cool new watch and how it’s shock-proof, just like Cockney Chris’.

I get many of the same remarks as Chris got all those months before, so, like Chris, I decided to prove it to them all.

I took the watch off and threw it on the floor as hard as I could.

It smashed into a thousand fucking pieces and all my friends fell about laughing.

I was devastated.

Not only had my beloved Baby-G disintegrated, but so had all my teenage pride. I think a stray tear may have even made its way down my cheek.

## WTF, Nan?!

I got home that night and *immediately* phoned my nan. On a landline might I add. It was the 90s, yanno. The conversation went something like this:

**Me:** *Nan, what the hell? I threw my Baby-G on the floor in school today and it smashed!*

**Nan:** *YOU THREW YOUR WATCH ON THE FLOOR???!!!*

**Me:** *Yeah, they’re shock resistant. Cockney Chris threw his on the floor in PE and nothing happened. That’s what should have happened to mine.*

**Nan:** *Well I wasn’t going to pay all that money for a watch, so I got a cheap one from the local market. I wasn’t expecting you to throw the bloody thing on the floor, you idiot! Put your mum on the phone…*

- - - - - -

Needless to say, the watch was a fake. It was a cheap knock-off that my nan paid £5 for down the local market, but I had no idea. I was a naive kid.

I got the bollocking of my life from my mum (and a slap around the ear). So not only did I have no Baby-G, I got a slap round the ear from my mum, my nan was pissed off at me and I was the laughing stock of the school.

Good. Times.

## Final thoughts

So let this be a lesson to you, folks. **Don’t throw your watch on the floor**. Learn from my idiocy.

It wasn’t until much later that I got my first *real* G-Shock. It was when I was in the Army in my early 20s. That thing was a tank and I still have it somewhere.

It survived deployments all over the world, including Iraq and Afghanistan and was still ticking, on its original battery, when I left the Army. It was a fantastic watch.

It’s just as shame my little Baby-G wasn’t quite as robust.

Oh well, we live and learn.
