DuckDuckGo, the [privacy centric search firm](https://duckduckgo.com) have been found to be allowing Microsoft trackers through their browser. It’s dishonest, and I’m really disappointed.

Last night the news broke that DuckDuckGo have been [effectively whitelisting Microsoft trackers in their browser](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/duckduckgo-browser-allows-microsoft-trackers-due-to-search-agreement/) as a result of their agreement with the tech giant. Brilliant.

I’ve been using DDG as my search engine of choice ever since [I started De-Googling](/de-googling-my-life-01-browser-search/) a few years back. On the whole, I really like DDG; the technical results can sometimes be lacklustre, but their [bangs feature](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) allows me to quickly search using [Startpage](https://startpage.com) if I don’t like the results I’m getting.

I don’t really use the DDG web browser, however. And that’s where this issue exists.

## So what’s the problem then?

With search being unaffected by this issue, you may be thinking *what’s the problem, Kev? You don’t use their browser so you’re not impacted.*

That comment is accurate…kind of. The issue for me boils down to one thing…

**Trust.**

DuckDuckGo tout themselves as being highly transparent and privacy respecting in everything they do. So to discover that they have been keeping this tidbit of information from their users — one that goes against the very fibre of the company — is a little concerning for me.

Damn right it is, DDG! So why have you been keeping this from us? Come on, folks. You’re supposed to be the good guys in all this!

## Will I stop using DuckDuckGo?

I don’t think I will, and that’s for a number of reasons. Firstly, I really like their search engine. It works well, and the bangs feature is practically muscle memory at this point.

Also, my oldest son says “*DuckDuckGo it*” instead of “*[Google it](/is-there-a-better-term-than-google-it/)*” so there’s that. On a serious note though, I don’t think the alternatives are as good.

- [Startpage](https://startpage.com) would be the closest, but I really don’t like their purple colour scheme.
- [Brave search](https://search.brave.com) is a possibility, but they’re owned and managed by a [homophobic douchebag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich#Appointment_to_CEO_and_resignation).
- [Kagi](https://kagi.com) looks promising, but I feel like $10/m for search is a little steep. But what’s the price of privacy, amirite?
- I could self-host my search engine, using something like [Searx](https://searx.github.io/searx/), but I really don’t have time for that.
- Then there’s all the others. They all have their issues that make them no better than DDG for one reason or another.

So yeah, I won’t be leaving DuckDuckGo behind anytime soon, I don’t think. But I do trust them a little less after all this.

**I’m not angry, DDG. I’m disappointed.** 😞
