There are places to go, books to read, and movies to watch. So it’s a little unfair when he gets himself killed crossing the street.<br><br>Bob wakes up a century later to find that corpsicles have been declared to be without rights, and he is now the property of the state. He has been uploaded into computer hardware and is slated to be the controlling AI in an interstellar probe looking for habitable planets.<br><br>The stakes are high: no less than the first claim to entire worlds. If he declines the honor, he’ll be switched off, and they’ll try again with someone else. If he accepts, he becomes a prime target. There are at least three other countries trying to get their own probes launched first, and they play dirty.' %}

*We Are Legion (We Are Bob)* is the first book in the *Bobiverse* series, of which there are 4 books in total.

*Bobiverse* was recommended to me by a number of people on [Fossodon](https://fosstodon.org) after I had written about the [Mistborn books](/the-mistborn-trilogy-book-recommendation/).

**I wasn’t disappointed – thank you, fediverse.**

I just couldn’t put this book down and ended up reading it in around 3 days. The story was captivating from the get-go and really appealed to my techie nature. Dennis E. Taylor was a developer in a former life, I believe, so there’s sprinkles of accurate technical info throughout the book.

It’s also clear that Dennis E. Taylor is a *big* Star Trek fan – there’s more than a few references to various series of Star Trek. So if you’re a Trekkie, this is also for you.

Some of the verbiage used was a little highbrow for me and my luddite vocabulary, but it didn’t detract from the story one bit.

If you’re into sci-fi / fantasy, I’d strongly recommend reading *Bobiverse*. I’ll be starting book number 2 tonight, so watch this space…
