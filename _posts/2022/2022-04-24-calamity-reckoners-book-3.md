*Calamity* is the third and final book in the *Reckoners* trilogy. I finished this a couple weeks ago, but wanted to stew on it for a while before I penned my thoughts down. Thatâ€™s because I wasnâ€™t really sure what I thoughtâ€¦and Iâ€™m still not.

The series as a whole was enjoyable, albeit a little juvenile at times. I didnâ€™t like, for example, that swear (cuss) words throughout were replaced by dystopian versions. So instead of *f\*ck* or *sh\*t* they would say *sparks* and *calamity*.

This is a theme that also carried through the [*Mistborn* series](/the-mistborn-trilogy-book-recommendation/) too, but for some reason I didnâ€™t find it as frustrating there.

<p><b>Calamity</b> ended the story that traversed the 3 books fairly well; Calamity is gone, but the book ended in such a way as to leave things open for another story to begin.</p>

<p>This has left things open for more books in the series, potentially. But considering this series concluded in 2016, and thereâ€™s yet to be another book released, Iâ€™m not sure Brandon Sanderson will write another *Reckoners* book.</p>

<p>Overall I enjoyed this book less than the other 2, but it was still a good read. The characters continued to develop well â€“ I particularly like how Sanderson continued to develop David and Meganâ€™s relationship. The significant change in Prof was also very interesting and very well written.</p>

Iâ€™ve now started reading the second trilogy in the Mistborn series; Wax and Wayne. Iâ€™m around 100 pages in, but Iâ€™m struggling to invest myself in the story. It certainly hasnâ€™t gripped me as much as Mistborn did.

Maybe itâ€™s time for a break from Brandon Sanderson so I can read something else. Thereâ€™s much more in his bibliography though, so Iâ€™ll **definitely** be returning.
