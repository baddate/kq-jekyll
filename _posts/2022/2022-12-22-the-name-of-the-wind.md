*The Name of the Wind* is a fantastic book that I really did enjoy. It's a long read, but worth it. The story follows Kvothe, who is a legendary wizard who tells his own story of his life.

This book only covers Kvothe's life up until is adolescent years, but don't let that put you off - he accomplished a lot during those years. From the story of his childhood with a traveling troupe of entertainers, to being the youngest pupil ever accepted into *The University*, to killing a bloody dragon!

This book ends leaving you yearning for more, so be warned; you will likely have to commit to 2 fairly long books. Personally, I'll be starting the second book, *The Wise Man's Fear*, tonight.

TL;DR - it's a fantastic book. Read it. Read it *now*.
