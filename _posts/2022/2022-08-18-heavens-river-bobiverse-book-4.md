{% include book.html cover='heavens-river.webp' alt='Heavens River book cover' author='Dennis E. Taylor' genre='Sci-fi / fantasy' published='24th Sept 2020' pages='608' stars='â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† / 3 stars' summary='More than a hundred years ago, Bender set out for the stars and was never heard from again. There has been no trace of him despite numerous searches by his clone-mates. Now Bob is determined to organize an expedition to learn Benderâ€™s fateâ€”whatever the cost.<br><br>But nothing is ever simple in the Bobiverse. Bobâ€™s descendants are out to the 24th generation now, and replicative drift has produced individuals who can barely be considered Bobs anymore. Some of them oppose Bobâ€™s plan; others have plans of their own. The out-of-control moots are the least of the Bobiverseâ€™s problems.' %}

[When I wrote about book 3](/all-these-worlds-bobiverse-book-3/), I said that the constant context switching was becoming tiresome, and I would have liked to see Taylor focus on a single storyline.

Well, be careful what you wish for, I suppose. Because in book 4 of *The Bobiverse*, *Heavenâ€™s River*, Taylor does just that. He focusses pretty much exclusively on a single storyline where Bob-1 goes to find a long lost clone, Bender.

The whole thing centres around a mega-structure called Heavenâ€™s River where a race a beaver like folks called the Quinlans live. So we now have beaver-like Quinlans, the Merekat like Pav and the bat-like Deltans. Honestly, it all feels a bit unimaginative and repetitive.

    <p>This book was longer than the others and I really felt it. 600 pages of Bob-1 running around Heavenâ€™s River, finding Bender, then running around avoiding capture over and over just felt a bit boring after a while.</p>

Overall I felt the book was *okay*, but I did feel like it dragged on a little too long. Thereâ€™s multiple references to how the Bobiverse is *thousands* strong on this book and I think Taylor missed a trick by not exploring some more of the Bobiverse in *Heavenâ€™s River*.

Taylor has started [working on Book 5](http://dennisetaylor.org/status-of-things/), Iâ€™ll probably pick it up and read it, but I have to be honest, *Heavenâ€™s River* didnâ€™t leave me yearning for more.
