Ever wondered something about me or wanted to ask me a question? Probably not, but here’s your opportunity to ask me anything you like.

I got this idea from [Björn Wärmedal](https://warmedal.se/~bjorn/posts/2022-04-01-ask-me-literally-anything.html), who posted the same thing recently. As Björn said, this could be fun.

## But why?

Great question. Well, not only could it be fun, but when I recently [wrote why an about page is important](/the-importance-of-an-about-page/), I talked about how it’s important for your readers to connect with you.

This will (hopefully) help with that. I don’t share a great deal from my personal life on this blog, so if you want to get to know me a little more, or if you want to ask a technical question. Be. My. Guest.

You can ask me literally anything you like and I’ll do my best to answer. If anyone does actually bother asking me a question, I’ll post the answers here on this blog.
