I was struggling between giving this 2 and 3 stars. While I **really** enjoyed the original Mistborn trilogy, but *Alloy of Law* failed to captivate me in the same way.

One thing that I struggled with throughout the book was the complexity of the whole Allomancy vs Feruchamy thing. In the original *Mistborn* trilogy Allomancy and Feruchamy are distinctly different and there’s only a handful of metals to track.

Now there seems to be many more metals and combining Allomancy with Feruchamy made things confusing for me.

I thought I’d hate the use of guns with Allomancy in this book, and the inevitable moving of bullets mid-flight. Sanderson wrote it will well though, making the bullets a key part of the story.

## My thoughts

I ended up going with 3 stars, because in true Sanderson fashion, the ending is full of action and really did captivate me. Overall I enjoyed the book and it is worth a read. Maybe I’ve just been spoiled by Sanderson’s other books and I’m being overly harsh with my rating.

[I’ve been reading a lot](/category/books/) of Sanderson lately, so I’m torn about whether or not to continue this second trilogy in the *Mistborn* saga, or have a break and reas something different.
