[Jeremy Sarber](https://jeremysarber.com/) recently asked a question in response to [my AMA](/category/ama/); whether I think the IndieWeb will ever become mainstream. Here’s my answer…

This is an interesting question, thanks for asking it, Jeremy. I do have [some history](/implementing-the-indieweb-into-my-website/) with the IndieWeb, and some opinions, so let’s dive in.

The short answer to the question is a resounding no, and it all boils down to the fact that the IndieWeb is really complicated to implement, so it will only ever appeal to developers.

## How can it be fixed?

I’m not sure it can to be honest. When [I removed the IndieWeb from this site](/removing-support-for-the-indieweb/) I was able to delete 7 plugins, all of which have a different function in the IndieWeb ecosystem.

There’s just so much to add in terms of markup, post types and front-end work to display it all, the whole thing gets messy, quick.

What we would need is a service that supports the IndieWeb out of the box. [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) comes close, but [when I tried it](/my-thoughts-on-micro-blog/), it felt convoluted and disjointed to use.

I think the convoluted nature of Micro.blog *is* because it’s integrated with the IndieWeb, so that makes it inherently more complicated to use.

Overall I think the IndieWeb is a great idea on the surface, but it has been poorly implemented.

Unless something drastic changes with the fundamental makeup of the IndieWeb, I don’t think it will ever gain anything close to mass adoption. Maybe if WordPress picked it up and rolled into the system by default, then it would have a chance; but short of that, I don’t see it happening.
