Ruled by the mysterious High Epic, Regalia, David is sure Babylon Restored will lead him to what he needs to find. And while entering another city oppressed by a High Epic despot is a gamble, David’s willing to risk it. Because killing Steelheart left a hole in David’s heart. A hole where his thirst for vengeance once lived. Somehow, he filled that hole with another Epic—Firefight. And he’s willing to go on a quest darker, and more dangerous even, than the fight against Steelheart to find her, and to get his answers.' %}

*Firefight*, the second book in [Brandon Sanderson’s](https://www.brandonsanderson.com) *Reckoners* trilogy is another great book that I really enjoyed. Following [book 1](/steelheart-book-recommendation/), the Reckoners head off to Babylon Restored (formerly Manhattan) to take on yet another epic, *Regalia*.

Honestly, I was expecting more of the same from book 1, thinking I wouldn’t enjoy it as much, but I was wrong. This book is full of twists and turns that continued to develop the various characters in the series.

The book also ended in such a way that left me wanting more, so I’ve already started the 3rd and final book in this trilogy, Calamity.
