Following on from my recent [Mistborn recommendation](/the-mistborn-trilogy-book-recommendation/), I’ve persisted with working through Brandon Sanderson’s bibliography and I continue to really enjoy his writing.

*Steelheart*, the first book of *The Reckoners* trilogy. It’s set in yet another dystopian world where there are infamous super heroes, called *Epics*.

*Steelheart* follows a group of Reckoners (the resistance to the Epics) in Newcago (formerly Chicago) where they hatch a plan to overthrow the ruling epic, *Steelheart*.

I finished this book in a few days and I’m now thoroughly enjoying its sequel, *Firefight* (post coming on that one soon). Sanderson continues to write in a simple, yet really engaging way and once again this book had me hooked from the start.
