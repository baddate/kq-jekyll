{: .tldr}
Cast your mind all the back to yesterday, dear reader, where I published the *[Ban the Spam](https://kevquirk.com/ban-the-spam/)* post. In that post I talk about combatting spam, yet having my contact email plastered across this site.

Problem is, I have 3 places where I list this contact email; on [my contact page](/contact/) (of course), on my [reply by email button](/adding-the-post-title-to-my-reply-by-email-button/) at the bottom of every post, and in a similar link at the bottom of every post in my RSS feed.

So as you can imagine, changing the contact address could be somewhat painful if I want to do it semi-regularly. Toward the end of yesterdayâ€™s post, I spoke briefly about this quandary:

> Iâ€™d prefer to set the email address in a single place and have it replicated to both my contact page and my button.
> 
> Iâ€™ll have to think about how best to do that â€“ Iâ€™m sure there will be a way for me to that within `functions.php` or something. If youâ€™re a WordPress ninja and have any ideas, Iâ€™m all ears.

I know just enough PHP to be dangerous, and have managed to come up with a solution for doing this. Itâ€™s probably not the best solution, but it works, so Iâ€™m happy.

I wanted to write this post mainly as a reminder to myself, but if it helps any of you guys, then all the better.

## Functions, short codes and PHP, oh my!

I was pretty sure that I would be able to do something in my `functions.php` file with short codes etc. and I was right!

So I already had a couple of functions defined in there â€“ one that pulls the post title for the *reply by email* button, and another that [I stole from my good pal, Ru Singh](https://rusingh.com/adding-a-comment-via-email-convenience-link/). (thanks, Ru!)

In this post Iâ€™m going to start again with the functions, just so itâ€™s clear to me what I did, when I read it back later.

## Defining the short codes

I decided I needed to define two [short codes](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/shortcodes/) for this to work. One that displays an arbitrary string of text (in this case, an email address). And another that pulls the postâ€™s title.

Letâ€™s look at the email address one first:

```
// Shortcode for inserting the site's contact email
add_shortcode( 'contact_email', 'contact_email' );

function contact_email( $atts ) {
    return 'test@example.com';
}
```

This shot code allows me to use `[contact_email]` anywhere on this site and WordPress will automagically insert the string after the `return`.

### Get the title

So weâ€™ve got the email address sorted. Next we need to do is create a short code that will pull the postâ€™s title. This function already exists in WordPress, I just needed a short code to pull it:

```
// Shortcode for generating the post title
add_shortcode( 'get_title', 'get_title' );

function get_title( $atts ) {
    return esc_attr( get_the_title( get_the_ID() ) );
}
```

As before, all I need to do now is place `[get_title]` anywhere inside a post and it will display that postâ€™s title.

## Putting it all together

I now had the nuts and bolts to get this shin-dig on the road. All I had to do was put it together. So first I changed the email address on my contact page from, you know, the *actual* email address that I want people to email and replace it with my `contact_email`. So when visit the page and it renders, you see whatever that `return` value is for the short code. I also set the `mailto:` value of the link to be the short code.

Confused yet? This is short code inception here, people! To try and give you a a better demonstration, here is a logical representation in HTML:

```
<a href="mailto:[contact_email]">[contact_email]</a>
```

So if the `return` string on our shortcode is `test@example.com`, the rendered HTML that you see would be:

```
<a href="mailto:<span style="font-family: var(--mono); background: var(--accent-bg);">test@example.com</span>"><span style="font-family: var(--mono); background: var(--accent-bg);">test@example.com</a></span>
```

Make sense? Good, Iâ€™m glad weâ€™re now on the same page. ðŸ™ƒ

### Fixing the button

So thatâ€™s the contact page done. Next I need to sort the *reply by email* button. This was again, really easy. All I had to do was change the buttonâ€™s link to be the following:

```
<a href="mailto:[contact_email]?subject=Reply to '[get_title]'">Reply by email</a>
```

Which renders a link that emails the address in the `contact_email` short code and includes the post title in the subject line:

```
<a href="mailto:test@example.com?subject=Reply to 'Updating My Contact Email Automatically'">Reply by email</a>
```

### Finally, the RSS feed

The last part was to bastardise Ruâ€™s code so that includes my short codes so that thereâ€™s a link at the end of every post in my RSS feed that, like my reply button, populates the `contact_email` in the `to` field and the subject line with the post title.

Hereâ€™s what that code looks like:

```
// Add reply link to RSS feed
add_filter( "the_content_feed", "feed_comment_via_email" );

function feed_comment_via_email($content)
{
   $content .= "<p><a href=\"mailto: " . do_shortcode( ' [contact_email] ' ) . "?subject=Reply to '" . do_shortcode( ' [get_title] ' ) . "'" . "\">Reply via email</a></p>";
   return $content;
}
```

All this code is doing, is injecting a link at the bottom of each RSS feed entry that, you guessed it, uses my short codes.

## How to use this code

Now that I have all the code I need, I just need to implement it on my theme. Iâ€™m using a [child theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/) for this so my theme changes persist through theme updates.

All I did was tie these code snippets together and added them to my `functions.php` file:

```
// Shortcode for inserting the site's contact email
add_shortcode( 'contact_email', 'contact_email' );

function contact_email( $atts ) {
    return 'test@example.com'; // Change this value when it's time to update your email everywhere!
}

// Shortcode for generating the post title
add_shortcode( 'get_title', 'get_title' );

function get_title( $atts ) {
    return esc_attr( get_the_title( get_the_ID() ) );
}

// Add reply link to RSS feed
add_filter( "the_content_feed", "feed_comment_via_email" );

function feed_comment_via_email($content)
{
   $content .= "<p><a href=\"mailto: " . do_shortcode( ' [contact_email] ' ) . "?subject=Reply to '" . do_shortcode( ' [get_title] ' ) . "'" . "\">Reply via email</a></p>";
   return $content;
}
```

### Changing the email

If at a later date I want to update the contact email for this site, all I need to do is replace the email address on line 5 above and the 3 locations where I use that address will automatically be updated.

No muss, no fuss. Winning.

Like I said at the start of this post, this probably isnâ€™t the most elegant solution to the problem, but itâ€™s a working solution so Iâ€™m happy. If you have any idea as to how I can improve this, please do let me know.
