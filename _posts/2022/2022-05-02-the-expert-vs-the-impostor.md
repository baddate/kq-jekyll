Iâ€™m about to start a new job. Itâ€™s a promotion, but my imposter syndrome is running wild. Letâ€™s talk about the expert versus the impostors.

So tomorrow, Tues 03rd May 2022, Iâ€™m starting a new role. Itâ€™s still with Bank of America and itâ€™s still in the Information Security team. But it is a promotion; Iâ€™m moving from a regional role (responsible for a function across Europe) to a global one.

**My imposter syndrome is going wild.**

This is something that always happens when I change role; it could be a new company, a new team, or even additional responsibility in my current role. I *always* worry about whether I can do the role.

This got me to thinking about my imposter syndrome, and in turn, being an expert. Being a relatively senior manager, I tend to hire regularly, so I read a lot of CVs. Pretty much every CV that I read has the word *expert* in there somewhere.

**My CV does not.**

To be clear, Iâ€™m not trying to belittle these people â€“ I do consider many of them to be experts in their field. I just donâ€™t think I am.

## What is an expert?

This may seem like a silly question, as we all know what an expert is, right? The dictionary defines an experts as:

> A person with a high level of knowledge or skill relating to a particular subject or activity.
> 
> <cite>[Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/expert)</cite>

But itâ€™s ambiguous. What equates to *a high level of skill*? How is that measured? For example, [Iâ€™m fairly good at HTML and CSS](/simple-css-framework/), but people like [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com), [Brad Taunt](https://tdarb.org) and [Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.co.uk) are the *experts*.

Ask my wife, mum or friends whether Iâ€™m an expert at making websites and theyâ€™re likely to say yes. **But Iâ€™m not.** All three of the guys above have forgotten more about HTML/CSS than Iâ€™ll ever know.

## There must be something Iâ€™m an expert in?

Iâ€™ve been wracking my brain trying to think of something Iâ€™d consider myself an expert in; and I honestly canâ€™t think of a single thing.

- **WordPress** â€“ weâ€™ve already established Iâ€™m not an expert in CSS and HTML, but what about WordPress or PHP? Nope. I know enough to be dangerous. Iâ€™m okay with WordPress and can build my own themes, but I have to search for a lot the PHP functions I build. [Chris Wiegman](https://chriswiegman.com); thereâ€™s your WordPress expert.
- **Fish Keeping** â€“ I love fish keeping. We have 4 large tanks in our house and all our fish are happy and healthy. Some of them are difficult fish to keep that require some specialist knowledge. But *every time* I go into our local fish store, I learn something new. Iâ€™m no expert at fish keeping.
- **InfoSec** â€“ ok, ok. InfoSec; this one is an easy win. My living is made in InfoSec, so surely Iâ€™m an expert at it, right?
    - I can use metasploit to compromise a machine, but I couldnâ€™t build my own exploits from scratch.
    - I know the basics of OSINT, but I donâ€™t think I could hunt down every facet of a person and use that to socially engineer them.
    - If your company has a cyber security incident, I could come in, manage the incident and provide support to the responders. I could *not* forensically analyse a compromised machine to the required standard.
    - Nope. Iâ€™m not an expert in InfoSec.

## **So what am I an expert in?**

I really donâ€™t know. Mediocrity maybe? Iâ€™m an expert in being just good enoughâ€¦though thatâ€™s a pretty rubbish thing to be an expert in.

This is why the word *expert* doesnâ€™t appear anywhere in my CV. I genuinely donâ€™t think Iâ€™m an expert in anything.

Sure, Iâ€™m *good* at things, but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m an expert in any of them. And this is where my imposter syndrome comes from. I go into the office every day and work with amazing people who can do amazing things that Iâ€™ll never be able to do.

Theyâ€™re the experts. Iâ€™m the imposter.

My wife would say Iâ€™m an expert at talking shit. And she would be right. ðŸ™ƒ

Joking aside, if I were to genuinely look at what Iâ€™m expert in, I suppose Iâ€™m an expert in knowing my limitations?
