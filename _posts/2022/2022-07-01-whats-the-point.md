I’m a proud privacy advocate, but recently I’ve been wondering what’s the point? It’s a losing battle…

I’ve been [De-Googling for years](/category/de-googling/). Maintaining privacy online is an ever evolving challenge, and it’s one I’m starting to get sick of fighting.

I’m sick of being *that guy* who either won’t use a service that everyone else is on, or *that guy* who forces everyone to use a tool that no-one else uses.

I recently joined a local table tennis team and they manage the entire team via [WhatsApp](/leave-whatsapp-messenger-nomad/), so I had to start using WhatsApp again if I wanted to be involved.

We’re also moving to a new area, and the local community has a Facebook group. In order to be involved, I’ve had to open a Facebook account. I’ve taken steps to keep it anonymous, but still, it makes me feel dirty.

## Privacy doesn’t exist online

Even me, a technical person, can’t avoid cesspits like Facebook and WhatsApp. Well, I could, but I don’t want to become a complete pariah.

Yes. Yes, I am. But I’m sick of the battle; I don’t have the energy or inclination for it anymore.

Fuck the internet. Fuck Facebook. Fuck this.
