I continue to really enjoy the *Bobiverse* series and I’m becoming more engaged with the characters. [When I first started reading Bobiverse](/we-are-legion-bobiverse-1/), with one person was cloning himself left, right and centre, I thought it might get a bit repetitive. But it hasn’t yet.

Taylor manages to give each Bob their own identity and nuance. He does this by the use of forcing every new Bob to pick a new name, and cleverly focussing on how the different Bob’s appear to demonstrate exaggerated traits from original Bob’s personality. This results in having very different Bobs, but it does make the inter-mingling storylines difficult to follow aa the Bobiverse grows. Especially since there are like 25 Bobs by the end of this book.

Bob-1, the original artificial Bob, spends most of this book being somewhat of a God to a sentient civilisation he dubbed *The Deltans*. For me, this and relocating the inhabitants of Earth to other systems, are the best storylines in the book.

Then there’s the storyline of *The Others*; the main antagonists in this book. Honestly, I’ve felt a little let down by this story so far. *The Others* feel like a mashup between [The Borg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg) from Star Trek and The [Vogons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogon) from Hitchhiker’s Guide.

Because of this, the storyline felt a little unoriginal to me, but it wasn’t a deal-breaker and only marginally impacted what was a great book. Plus, I think there’s way more to come from *The Others* in the next book.

No doubt I’ll be writing about that soon, so watch this space!
