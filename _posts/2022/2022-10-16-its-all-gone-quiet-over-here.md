Just a quick post to say that Iâ€™m still alive, but *very* busy. I havenâ€™t posted in a little bit because Iâ€™ve been so busy.

Iâ€™ve got some personal stuff going on, as well as a family, a busy job and a house move. Hopefully the sale will complete in a couple days from this post going live and normal service will resume. Pinky promise.

Iâ€™ve got a tonne of stuff on the back-burner that I want to write about, Iâ€™m even thinking about starting [an entirely new blog about watch collecting](https://fosstodon.org/web/@kev/109167519139140973). I just need to decide whether to base it on Jekyll, Hugo or WordPressâ€¦then inevitably change my mind 1000 times. ðŸ™ƒ

So **watch** this space (see what I did there) for updates on that.

Anyway, Iâ€™m still around, Iâ€™m just *really* busy. Iâ€™ll be back online and writing more of my drivel in the next few weeks. Stay safe and and Iâ€™ll see you fine people soon!
