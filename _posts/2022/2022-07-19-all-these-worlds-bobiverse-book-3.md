A couple of eighth-generation Bobs have found something out in deep space. All it will take to save the Earth and perhaps all of humanity is for them to get it to Sol – unless the Others arrive first.' %}

Another great instalment of the *Bobiverse* series; I think the fact that I’m making my way through these books so quickly is testament to how good they are.

I won’t give away any spoilers, but needless to say the Bobiverse is growing rapidly. There are androids, all kinds of aliens, the human race is colonising a number of planets and in the middle of all this…a tonne of Bobs.

It’s getting to the point now where I’m really struggling to keep up with the different Bobs by name (they all choose their own name when they’re cloned). However the names are less important, as the story lines are well written and easy to track.

I thought that by this point all the context switching between the various storylines would frustrate me (there’s around 8 or so main storylines), but that’s not the case. I’m really enjoying them.

Having said that, I’d really like it if Taylor took the time to develop the various storylines and characters more. Maybe some short stories within the series that focuses on a single Bob. That would be great. So Dennis, if you’re reading this, please boot up your computer and get to work. Kthxbye.

There’s one more book to go in the series (so far – Taylor has [kinda started working on book 5](http://dennisetaylor.org/status-of-things/)) so I’ll keep my eye out for that. But for the time being, I’ll be starting book 4 this evening…
