I’ve been feeling pretty burned out lately. I think it’s an accumulation of things, but I don’t know what to do about it.

I was in work today and I just felt utterly deflated an unmotivated. I have a stressful job (don’t we all; cry me a river, right?) but I’ve worked in much more stressful roles than I’m in now, so I don’t think it’s just that.

This has been building for some time now, so I took a couple of days off work last week to try and get some down time. It didn’t work. I feel *worse* this week.

I can’t put my finger on one specific thing that I think is causing it. It’s not work. It’s not the kids. It’s not the pets. It’s not my family. Maybe it’s an accumulation of things?

Whatever it is, something has to change. I’ve been exercising a lot lately, but have been unable to for the last week or so because of an injury. Maybe it’s a lack of endorphins from that? I have no idea.

I’m feeling utterly fed up and pissed off, but I don’t know why. Maybe I just need a detox from technology and the Internet for a while? Easier said than done when you work in the Information Security industry.

I don’t fucking know. Any help/advice is welcome, because I’m fresh out of ideas.

I’ve never felt like this before…
