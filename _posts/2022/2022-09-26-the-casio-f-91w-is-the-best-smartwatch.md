I recently stopped wearing my Apple Watch in favour of the classic Casio F-91W. This [humble little watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W) is the best smartwatch on the market in my opinion.

A little over a week ago, Joel [posted a picture of his watch on Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/web/@joel/109005194088466959) and it opened a MAHOOSIVE can of worms. People started posting photos of their Casio watches and I just had to get involved.

I‚Äôve had a number of Casio watches over the years, from really cheap ones that my parents bought me as a kid, to rather expensive G-Shock watches that survived deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan with the Army.

I‚Äôve always had a couple of Casio watches knocking around the house. When Joel published his post, I had 2. A [G-Shock M5610](https://g-shock.co.uk/gw-m5610u-1ber) and a [Green W-218H](https://www.casio.co.uk/w-218h-1avef). But for the most part, I was rocking a series 5 Apple Watch.

After all the talk of Casio watches within Joel‚Äôs thread, I decided to drop the princely sum of ¬£15 on a Casio F-91W. [First released in the late 80‚Äôs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W), this fantastic little watch has proven itself time and again to be a great device.

I made a small modification where I switched the standard strap for a NATO strap, as I much prefer them ‚Äì I have one on my G-Shock too.

## Ditching the Apple Watch

I recently wrote about all of [the Apple devices I now own](/icreep/). Honestly, it‚Äôs a little excessive. So I thought this was a good time to try ditching the Apple Watch, since it‚Äôs the Apple device I‚Äôm the least impressed with.

After switching to the F-91W, I quickly realised how often I subconsciously checked the Apple Watch for notifications. I have all audible notifications (except for phone calls) disabled on the watch, but I still kept checking it more than I thought.

It‚Äôs now been around a week since I stopped wearing the Apple Watch and the only thing I really miss is the ability to use Siri in the car to change music. It‚Äôs a pretty small thing, I‚Äôm sure you will agree. So I‚Äôve given the Apple Watch to my wife and she‚Äôs happily using it.

## Why is the Casio F-91W the best smartwatch?

Now, strictly speaking, the humble F-91W isn‚Äôt a smartwatch. But to me it does a few things that I personally think are *really* smart that put ahead of the Apple Watch.

### Price

I didn‚Äôt pay for my Apple Watch; I got it via a rewards program in work. But even now, a refurbished series 5 Apple Watch is at least ¬£300 on [the Apple store](https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/watch/apple-watch-series-5).

My Casio F-91W was ¬£15 for the watch itself and another ¬£15 for the NATO strap. So 1:10th of the cost of my Apple Watch. And guess what‚Ä¶they both tell the time!

That‚Äôs pretty smart if you ask me.

### Battery life

I had to charge my Apple Watch every single night. At a push I might have gotten 2 days out of it, but unlikely. Let‚Äôs give it the benefit of the doubt though, and say I could get 48 hours out of a single charge.

My F-91W sports a **7 year battery life.** That‚Äôs 61,632 hours, folks! So on a single ‚Äúcharge‚Äù my F-91W will last 1,278x longer than my Apple Watch.

C‚Äômon ‚Äì that‚Äôs pretty bloody smart, no?

### Size &amp; weight

This is the pi√®ce de r√©sistance of the Casio F-91W, folks. It‚Äôs so bloody small and light that I barely even feel it on my wrist. So much so that my (small by G-Shock standards) M5610 feels like I‚Äôm wearing a house brick on my wrist.

It weights just 21 grams, including the strap. The Apple Watch, on the other hand, weights a chubby 50 grams. It‚Äôs also a lot bigger than the little Casio.

I‚Äôm not a fan of big watches, I never have been. So the Casio suits me perfectly.

It‚Äôs also so cheap that I don‚Äôt need to really worry about it. If I scratch the screen for example, it‚Äôs not the end of the world. I can get a scratch repair kit, or just buy a new one if it‚Äôs really bad.

## Final thoughts

So the Casio F91-W is way smaller, lighter, cheaper and has a battery that lasts over 1000x longer than the Apple Watch. Plus, they both tell the time!

Casio really nailed it with this watch ‚Äì for my money, it‚Äôs the best smartwatch out there. üôÉ

I know the Casio F-91W isn‚Äôt actually a smartwatch, so please don‚Äôt email me whinging about the fact it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúreal‚Äù smartwatch. I‚Äôm just having fun; it is a great watch though.
