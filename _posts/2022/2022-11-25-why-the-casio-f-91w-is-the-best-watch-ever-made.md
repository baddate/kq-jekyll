Even if you arenâ€™t convinced by the end of this post, I hope we will be able to agree that the Casio F-91W is a fantastic watch for *many* reasons.

Ok, with that pre-waffle out of the way, letâ€™s look at *some* of the reasons why the Casio F-91W is the best watch ever madeâ€¦

## 1. Itâ€™s so cheap!

Thatâ€™s right, itâ€™s ridiculously cheap! Depending on where you buy it, it can cost as little as Â£10, sometimes going up to the dizzy heights of Â£30 if youâ€™re unlucky or want one of the cool colour variants (more on those later).

For the mere price of Â£10, you get a watch thatâ€™s accurate to +/-30 seconds per month â€“ thatâ€™s better than ANY automatic watch (yay for quartz!) â€“ a battery that lasts up to 10 years, a stop watch, an alarm and an hourly beep that often reminds me to pickup the kids from school.

You even get an (albeit rubbish, but serviceable) backlight. I mean, câ€™mon, thatâ€™s a pretty good deal, donâ€™t you think? Honestly, I donâ€™t understand how Casio makes money from it.

## 2. Cool and vintage AF

The F-91W was first introduced in 1988 and hasnâ€™t changed since then. So when we say *vintage* here, we really do mean **vintage**. Itâ€™s a piece of 1980â€™s nostalgia for less than the price of a couple coffees.

Some people donâ€™t like the 1980â€™s look, I get that, but scroll back up and look at this thing againâ€¦itâ€™s beautiful!

## 3. Thereâ€™s different colours

You want gold? No problem. Silver? Thatâ€™s fine too. Khaki green? Casio have you covered. Bright yellowâ€¦bright yellow?! Yeah, ok, they even have that colour if thatâ€™s what floats your boat.

I myself have 6 Casio F-91Ws in my collection, and they all have a completely different feeling to them. I love wearing them.

## 4. Itâ€™s iconic

The humble F-91W has even been [used by terrorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W#Usage_in_terrorism) as a timer for their bombs. Seriously.

Ok, thatâ€™s probably not the best way of being *iconic*, so letâ€™s even things out a littleâ€¦President Obama also wore an F-91W! See, theyâ€™re not all bad.

Also, Casio also sells over **3 million** of these things **every year**. Theyâ€™re literally everywhere. Anything that sells in the millions has to be cool, right?

## 5. Theyâ€™re copied

Whatâ€™s the saying? *Imitation is the highest form of flattery*, right? Well, the venerable F-91W getâ€™s imitated *a lot*.

Copies of this plucky little watch litter the Internet. So much so that Casio had to add a [validation mechanism](https://youtu.be/c5QpKlC8AtM) to their watches to help prove theyâ€™re real.

It beggars belief that a Â£10 watch even has a counterfeit market, but it just goes to show how good this thing is.

## I could go onâ€¦

But I wonâ€™t. I think you get the picture by now; for a mere Â£10, you get a watch thatâ€¦

- Will last for 10 years, at least!
- Keeps great time
- Is legitimately vintage
- Has lots of different colour options
- Was used by terrorists
- But worn by presidents
- Is sold by the millions
- Is copied to within an inch of its life

With all this combined, I put it to you, dear reader, that the humble Casio F-91W is **the best watch ever made**.
