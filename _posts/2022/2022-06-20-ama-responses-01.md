Iâ€™ve received a number of responses to my request to [Ask Me Anything](/ask-me-anything/). Some questions can be answered quickly, others require an entire post of their own.

Hereâ€™s some of the answers that donâ€™t require their own post:

**Nicolas asked: What is the story behind your blogâ€™s logo?**

There is no story to be honest. I wanted a logo that was a simple monogram of my initials, but I couldnâ€™t make the K &amp; Q look good together. So I paid someone on Fiverr to do it for me. ðŸ™ƒ

**Thelma asked: Iâ€™m wondering what gives you hope for the future?**

Honestly, not a lot. The world is going to shit; mortgages are rising, the world is getting hotter. Over-population is getting worse and because of that weâ€™re running out of resources.

These are some of the reasons why my wife and I decided not to have biologically children and adopted instead. I worry about how the next generation are going to manage.


**Joel asked: I donâ€™t notice a lot of videogame talk at all in your posts. Are you not interested in them? what about your kids?**

Iâ€™m not really interested in gaming â€“ I donâ€™t have time. I play Sudoku and some Among Us on my phone from time to time, but thatâ€™s about it. I do have an Xbox, but I donâ€™t remember the last time I turned it on.

I occasionally play Minecraft with my oldest son, but itâ€™s very rare as I donâ€™t get much spare time these days.

**Joel also asked: Also if you had to wear a hat for the rest of your life, which one would you use?**

I donâ€™t really like hats; they donâ€™t suit me (I have a MASSIVE head). I suppose it would be my motorbike helmet so Iâ€™d be out on my bike all the time.

Is that cheating? ðŸ™ƒ


**DuÅ¡an** asked: I was wondering how do you manage your responsibilities between family, work and hobbies like running Fosstodon. Are you a very organized person or are you more turbulent and figure stuff out on the fly?**

**On a side note, what kind of music do you listen to?**

I am a **very** organised person. Iâ€™m also one of those people who doesnâ€™t like to let things hang around. I like to just get sh\*t done. So I dive in and get going, if I make mistakes along the way, I can always loop back and fix them.

Ultimately though, I have very little free time. What free time I do have, I make sure itâ€™s away from computers entirely â€“ usually something outside, like walking the dogs, riding my motorbikes etc. Time to decompress is so important.

With regards to music, I like all kinds of music. Classic rock like Lynyrd Skynyrd, Toto, Rolling Stones, AC/DC etc. some pop, indie, and everything in between. I donâ€™t like a single genre; that would be doing music a disservice, I think. If I like a song, I like it. No matter what the genre.

To give you an idea, the songs that have come on while writing this post are:

- Rebel Rebel â€“ Davie Bowie
- Funeral â€“ Lukas Graham
- Ms. Jackson â€“ Outkast
- Pump It Up â€“ Elvis Costello
- Minor Thing â€“ Red Hot Chili Peppers
- Together â€“ The Raconteurs
- Sonnet â€“ The Verve
- Reet Petite â€“ Jackie Wilson
- Valerie â€“ The Zutons
- Massacre of El Kuroke â€“ The Dead South
- Kiss â€“ Prince
