I’ve had this post in my drafts folder for *months* now Actually, it’s ever since [I realised how hard it is to manage content with Static Site Generators](/how-i-manage-jekyll-content/), and flipped back to WordPress.

I had some rough notes, but never got around to writing the post out in a long-form. Here’s my notes:

- *Hear all the time that SSGs are easy to setup and simple to get going with.*
- *Sure, like pinning a broken bone is easy for a surgeon. Devs don’t realise that is a massive barrier for entry for anyone who isn’t a dev.*
- *Most people struggle with the concept of FTP’ing files to a server, let alone CI/CD, Git, layouts, markdown and front matter.*
- *Oh you wanna write a post? Sure, open a text editor and type out all the meta data first. Many people just want something they can log into, type a post and hit publish.*
- *I know CMS’s exist for SSG’s, but they’re can’t be easily deployed by most people.*
- *I’m not against SSG’s. I think they’re incredible pieces of software, which I use myself for certain projects, but please stop saying they’re simple to use, because they are not.*

Then I read a post by Florens Verschelde, entitled *Static Site Generators,* where he said everything I wanted to say and then some. So why re-invent the wheel?

> It turns out that **static site generators are terrible at handling content**. Which is too bad, because that’s one of their very few features to begin with.
