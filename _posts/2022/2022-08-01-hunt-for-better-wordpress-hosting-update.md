Nearly a year ago, I wrote about [my hunt for better WordPress hosting](https://kevquirk.com/the-hunt-for-better-wordpress-hosting/) and the results werenâ€™t great. Hereâ€™s an updateâ€¦

Letâ€™s start with a quick re-cap â€“ last time I ended up sticking with my self-managed Plesk server, CDN, caching and a few other bits. Hereâ€™s what my total outlay looked like for WordPress hosting:

| Line item | Annual price ($) |
|---|---|
| VPS hosting | $105.00 |
| Yoast Premium | $123.00 |
| Newsletter Glue | $76.00 |
| WP Rocket | $49.00 |
| Updraft SFTP Plugin | $16.50 |
| Bunny CDN | $12.00 |
| **Annual total:** | **$381.50** |
| **Monthly total:** | **$31.79** |

My intention was to cut costs, while keeping performance up. With this setup I was getting a perfect score on [Googleâ€™s Lighthouse](https://web.dev/measure), so the new solution had to be really performant too. Because, you know, [WordPress isnâ€™t slow](/the-case-for-wordpress/)!

Iâ€™m sure you will agree that $30/month to run what is effectively a hobby website isnâ€™t great. Especially when I could [host a static site for free](/how-to-build-jekyll-site-simple-css/). But Iâ€™m happy to report, dear reader, that I have made some changes which have saved me some ðŸ’°, *and* kept performance up.

## WordPress hosting changes

In the last post I explored [Cloudways](https://vrlps.co/9xZaemi/cp), but discounted them as they recommended a 2GB instance for production sites. This meant that they were *more* expensive than the server I had.

I decided to take a punt and setup a Cloudways server with 1GB RAM, instead of the recommended 2GB. Iâ€™m really glad I did, because itâ€™s **more than enough**.

I host this site, a staging site, 2 other personal sites and 2 sites for a friend. Yet the resources never get close the being maxed out.

[I donâ€™t know how many visitors I get to this blog](/revisiting-the-web-analytics-rabbit-hole/), but the [last time I checked](/chasing-visitors-the-web-analytics-rabbit-hole/) it was in the 10s of thousands a month. The take away here, dear reader, is that you shouldnâ€™t believe all you read on the Internet. Itâ€™s almost like Cloudways want to make *more* money by recommending more expensive servers than you may need. ðŸ™ƒ

As well as changing hosts, I also made other changes to the tech stack and services behind the scenes. Hereâ€™s what I did:

- Cancelled Yoast Premium and went with [their free plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/)
- [Abandoned my newsletter](/why-are-newsletters-so-painful/), so Newsletter Glue was no longer needed
- Got rid of WP Rocket as Cloudways have their own caching plugin

## What does hosting cost now?

So what does all this shenanigans cost me now then? Well, letâ€™s take look:

| Line item | Annual price ($) |
|---|---|
| VPS hosting | $180.00 |
| Updraft SFTP Plugin | $16.50 |
| Bunny CDN | $12.00 |
| **Annual total:** | **$208.50** |
| **Monthly total:** | **$17.37** |

By making these changes, Iâ€™ve been able to pretty much half the amount Iâ€™m paying for my WordPress hosting. Pretty. Happy. With. That.

And yes, Iâ€™ve also managed to keep the performance up there. This site now scores 99 for performance and 100 for everything else on Google Lighthouse.

Youâ€™ll notice that Iâ€™m still using [Bunny CDN](https://bunny.net?ref=gnn7bkvipc) and the [Updraft SFTP plugin](https://updraftplus.com). Bunny is a *fantastic* service that makes this site load quickly from pretty much anywhere on earth, so that had to stay. And we all know that [backups are very important](/i-nearly-lost-all-of-my-data/), so even though backups are provided by Cloudways, thereâ€™s no harm in doing my own as well.

## Final thoughts

All in all, I think this exercise has been a success. Iâ€™m paying half the price, but still getting 99% of the performance. Literally. Letâ€™s be honest here, folks, no one is going to notice that 1% in the real world.

If youâ€™re in the market for a highly performant, fully managed WordPress host, you can do *a lot* worse than [Cloudways](https://vrlps.co/9xZaemi/cp). I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be moving away from their service any time soon.
