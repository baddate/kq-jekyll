I decided to start my newsletter around 8 months ago. To be honest, I didn&#8217;t think it through properly and the whole thing was somewhat of an aimless exercise.

But over the last 8 months my newsletter has grown an identity and I now have a much better idea of where I want to do with it. So with that, I&#8217;ve been spending some time re-writing and re-designing [the newsletter page](/newsletter) on this site.

## Newsletter changes {#h-newsletter-changes}

If you have been subscribed to my newsletter for more than a month or so, you will likely remember that it used to be called **Craves Coffee**. Like I said &#8211; it was all a little aimless.

Last month I renamed it to **The Meta Letter** and I&#8217;ve taken some time to actually think about what I want to include in future issues. So from now on, here&#8217;s what will happen with The Meta Letter:

  * New issues will be released during the last week of each month.
  * Each issue will be split into 3 sections:
      * 📝 From my blog
      * 👨‍💻 Around the web
      * 🧐 Meta Picks

## 📝 From my blog {#h-from-my-blog}

This section will include a couple of sentences about highlights from my blog over the last month. The list won't include everything, because let's be honest, I write a lot of 💩 on this site!

This is likely to be the shortest section of the newsletter since most people who subscribe are likely to already be readers of my blog.

## 👨‍💻 Around the web {#h-around-the-web}

I read a lot of stuff online; blogs, [RSS feeds](/why-having-a-full-post-rss-feed-is-a-good-idea/) and places like Hacker News & Lobsters are where I usually hang around looking for content to consume. I also subscribe to a number of excellent newsletters; <a href="https://www.tldrnewsletter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TLDR</a>, <a href="https://tedium.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tedium</a>, <a href="https://masterwp.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MasterWP</a> and <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Benedict Evans' newsletter</a>.

From these various sources I tend to find a number of hidden gems (or not so hidden, as the case may be). This is where the _Around the web_ section of my newsletter comes in. It's a collection of posts, essays or articles that I've found particularly interesting that month.

## 🧐 Meta Picks {#h-meta-picks}

Finally we come to _Meta Picks_, these are useful or interesting &#8216;things' I have found in the last month. It could be an interesting or cool website, an application, a GitHub repository, or something else entirely.

_Meta Picks_ is basically my catch-all for anything that has piqued my interest but doesn't fall into the other buckets.

## ✅ Subscribe to my newsletter {#h-subscribe-to-my-newsletter}

So far my newsletter has been way more successful than I thought it was going to be, and I'm really enjoying producing it. If you think you will find any of the above interesting, you can subscribe via [RSS](/category/newsletter/feed), or using the form below.

<p class="notice">
  Issues are released to the RSS feed around 3 days after they are delivered to email subscribers.

I hope to be invading your inbox very soon!
