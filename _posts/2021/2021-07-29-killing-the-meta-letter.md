So I&#8217;ve been thinking about killing my newsletter, The Meta Letter, recently. Today I decided to take the plunge and kill it off.

It&#8217;s bittersweet, but I had to. I needed the mental cycles back. You can <a href="https://metaletter.net/the-end-of-the-meta-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read more about it here</a> if you&#8217;re interested.

For the time being I&#8217;ll keep The Meta Letter site up, but I&#8217;ll replace it with a public archive at some point I imagine.
