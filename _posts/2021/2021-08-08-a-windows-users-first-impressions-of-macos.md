  I recently bought myself an <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M1 Macbook Air</a> and I wanted to share my first impressions of MacOS as someone who has <strong>never</strong> used it before.
</p>

I&#8217;ve been a user of Windows for as long as I can remember &#8211; since 3.11 at least. I&#8217;ve also been a Linux user for the last 10 years or so. However, a few weeks ago I moved back to Windows full time and [stopped using Linux](https://kevq.uk/a-sombre-goodbye-to-linux/). Since then I&#8217;ve been enjoying a problem free experience on my Windows 10 machines.

However, I yearned for some of what Linux can offer. BASH, for example. I knew that MacOS and Linux had similar roots, and I&#8217;m already using some Apple hardware. I&#8217;d heard good things about the new M1 Macbooks, so off I went to buy one.

## My first impressions of MacOS {#h-my-first-impressions-of-macos}

I&#8217;ve been using my Mac for a few days now and there are some things that I really like about the OS, and others that I&#8217;m finding a little frustrating. I think the frustrations are mostly down to my lack of experience with the OS though.

So let&#8217;s take a look at some of the good and bad things I&#8217;ve found from my first impressions with MacOS&#8230;

## The good

Starting with the good stuff is the best place to start, I think. That way I don&#8217;t come across as a moaning mini.

### The polish {#h-the-polish}

As expected, MacOS is **extremely** polished. Everything looks great, frankly there isn&#8217;t a pixel out of place. It&#8217;s beautiful. When I&#8217;m talking about the polish, I don&#8217;t just mean the look though.

Notifications work extremely well and have additional context in them. For example, when a calendar notification pops up, you can expand the notification itself and see the details of the calendar entry. I&#8217;ve never seen that in Windows or Linux and it&#8217;s great for productivity.

### Integration with other kit {#h-integration-with-other-kit}

Since [moving to iPhone](https://kevq.uk/why-im-ditching-android/) a few years ago, I&#8217;ve slowly expanded the Apple kit I use. I now have an iPad and an iWatch too. The integration between these devices is astonishing. Nothing else is even close.

Calendars, contacts, mail, notifications, notes, reminders, settings, bookmarks, files. It&#8217;s all synced effortlessly. This isn&#8217;t a huge shock since Apple control both the hardware and the software, but the experience really is exceptional. It&#8217;s just so darn easy to use.

### Everything has worked {#h-everything-has-worked}

When I started using Linux around 10 years ago, there were lots of issues that I had to overcome. Some small, like replacing Word and Excel with LibreOffice. But others were massive, like incompatible wireless drivers and getting use to installing applications in a number of ways. It was great fun though.

I was expecting to have the same kind of issues when starting to use MacOS, but that wasn&#8217;t the case. Everything just worked out of the box, and installing software, whether that&#8217;s via the app store, or manually, is intuitive and effortless.

I was also expecting there to be some apps that aren&#8217;t available for Mac, especially since this is an M1 Mac. But that wasn&#8217;t the case either. Everything I&#8217;ve needed has been available &#8211; Inkscape, GIMP, Filezilla, Atom, Syonology Drive. Everything.

It&#8217;s not all sun and roses though. Let&#8217;s look at some the frustrations I&#8217;ve had during my first impressions of MacOS.

## The bad

I think the biggest frustration I&#8217;ve had with MacOS is the keyboard. It&#8217;s a completely different layout and many of the keyboard shortcuts are different. Having said that, I&#8217;m slowly getting used to them.

Problem is, I use Windows at work, so I&#8217;m flipping from one keyboard layout to the other. This is resulting in me burning lots of extra brain cycles at the moment, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll get use to it eventually.

Aside from the keyboard layout, here&#8217;s a few other frustrations I&#8217;ve found with MacOS&#8230;

### Deleting files {#h-deleting-files}

In Windows and Linux, if I want to delete something, I hit the `delete` key and the file is sent to the recycle bin. If I hit `shift + delete` the file skips the recycle bin and is immediately deleted.

**There is no such functionality in MacOS** and it drives me up the wall. Instead I have to right-click and select _Send to Bin_. Then I need to remember to empty the bin every now and then.

There is no delete key on the Mac keyboard, so I can&#8217;t just hit a key to _Send to Bin_ either. I&#8217;m very keyboard centric when I use a computer, so having to reach for my mouse to delete stuff is frustrating.

Luckily I found that I could add <a href="https://www.guidingtech.com/create-custom-keyboard-shortcuts-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">custom keyboard shortcuts</a>, so I mapped `⌘ + d` to the _Move to Bin_ function, which seems to have resolved the issue.

**However**&#8230;there&#8217;s no way that I&#8217;ve found to delete files from external storage, like a USB drive. The option to _Move to Bin_ isn&#8217;t available. I still have no idea how to delete files from a USB drive in MacOS without formatting the entire drive. **That seems ridiculous to me.**

### Why you no cut? {#h-why-you-no-cut}

When it comes to moving files in MacOS, the option to `cut` isn&#8217;t there. It&#8217;s just not a concept in MacOS. The only thing you can `cut` is text, not files/folders.

For the first couple of days I was doing a copy and paste, then deleting the original file. I got sick of doing this and ended up hunting around the Internet for a solution.

The shortcut command for pasting in MacOS is `⌘ + v` however, if you use `⌘ + ⌥&nbsp;+ v` it moves the file instead of copying it. This is effectively the same thing, so I was glad I could find a solution to that one.

### Maximise is actually full screen {#h-maximise-is-actually-full-screen}

When I first started using MacOS, I assumed that the maximise button on a window&#8217;s titlebar would, you know, _maximise_ the window. Just like it does in every other OS I&#8217;ve ever used.

Not in MacOS. When you hit that button in MacOS, the window goes full screen. Which isn&#8217;t what I wanted at all.

Some apps allow you to double click on the titlebar, which will maximise the window in the traditional sense of the word. But that doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case for all apps. It would be nice if the maximise button was configurable in the system preferences.

Anyway, a minor annoyance, but an annoyance nonetheless.

### General window management {#h-general-window-management}

Window management is probably my biggest frustration so far. It&#8217;s muscle memory for me that my taskbar is at the top of the screen and it displays all my open windows. MacOS has the dock, and I can&#8217;t put it at the top of the screen.

I also find the dock somewhat of an eyesore, so I tend to keep it hidden. Problem is, there&#8217;s no way for me to easily see what I have open then and the mechanism for unhiding the dock with the mouse is a little wonky at times. `<code>⌘`&nbsp;+ tab</code> allows me to easily switch between windows though, so that&#8217;s a saving grace.

I&#8217;m also use to closing a window and that application being killed. In MacOS that doesn&#8217;t happen. The application still runs in the background and by clicking the `x` button, it seems that all I&#8217;m doing is closing the current window, not the application itself. I&#8217;m not sure whether those processes are hibernated, but I feel like it&#8217;s wasting resources. Time will tell on front.

## Final thoughts {#h-final-thoughts}

Overall, my first impressions of MacOS have been positive. There are less frustrations than I thought there would be and I&#8217;ve since decided to buy a <a href="https://amzn.to/3jzKsC6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">docking station</a> to allow me to move to MacOS full time.

Hopefully this will help me get accustom to the inner working of the Mac a little more quickly. If it all works out, I&#8217;ll probably sell [my desktop PC](https://kevq.uk/upgrading-my-desktop-pc/).

**Are you a MacOS convert? If so, what were your first impressions of MacOS?** **And are there any frustrations I haven&#8217;t come across yet that you think I should be aware of?**

**Also, if you know how to delete files on an external drive in MacOS, please do get in touch to let me know. I&#8217;d be ever so grateful.**
