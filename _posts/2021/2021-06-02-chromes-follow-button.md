I just read Scott Nesbitt’s latest weekly musing (it’s an excellent newsletter, you should definitely <a href="https://buttondown.email/weeklymusings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subscribe</a>) on Chrome’s new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/chromes-rss-powered-follow-button-is-like-a-rebooted-google-reader/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">follow button</a>.

In the post, Scott talks about how people are touting this new feature as the RSS killer. Ironically, I read Scott’s musing in my RSS reader. He says:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    The narrative about the death, or ill health, of RSS persists. A headline at&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/undead-again-google-brings-back-rss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Techcrunch</a>, for example, proclaims that&nbsp;<em>Google revives RSS</em>. But Google’s second go around won’t save RSS, if only because RSS doesn’t need saving. It won’t revitalize or revive RSS (sorry, TechCrunch), if only because RSS isn’t struggling. RSS isn’t fading away. It doesn’t require any tender ministrations
  </p>

  <cite>Scott Nesbitt</cite>
</blockquote>

I completely agree with Scott here; [RSS is very important](https://kevq.uk/please-add-rss-support-to-your-site/) and doesn’t need saving. Having said that, I don’t see this service as a replacement, or competitor to, RSS. I see it more as Google’s attempt to implement a service like Mozilla’s <a href="https://getpocket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pocket</a>.

Either way it’s an excellent piece, as Scott’s writing often is. [Here’s a link](https://weeklymusings.net/) so you can read his musing yourself.

**What do you think? Are Google trying kill RSS here?**
