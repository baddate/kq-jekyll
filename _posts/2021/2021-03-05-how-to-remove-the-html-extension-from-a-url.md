  I was recently asked how to remove the HTML extension from a URL on a webpage. I provided some quick advice on how to do this, but thought it would be good to write a post on how to do it.
</p>

If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about here, it&#8217;s when you visit a website and the URL looks something like this &#8211; `https://example.com/about.html`. Specifically, the `.html` part is the problem here as most people would prefer to see `https://example.com/about` instead. It&#8217;s nicer, don&#8217;t you think?

There are a couple of ways to remove the HTML extension from a URL, so let&#8217;s go through a couple of them, shall we? To help me along, I&#8217;ve spun up a quick test site using <a href="https://simplecss.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Simple.css</a>. It looks something like this:

<img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="609" src="/assets/images/wp-images/2021/03/test-site-01.png" alt="Remove HTML test site" class="wp-image-4757" srcset="/assets/images/wp-images/2021/03/test-site-01.png 1000w, /assets/images/wp-images/2021/03/test-site-01-610x371.png 610w, /assets/images/wp-images/2021/03/test-site-01-768x468.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />  

Notice the URL in the address bar &#8211; `https://test.kq.md`. Let&#8217;s visit the about page and see what happens&#8230;

<img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="611" src="/assets/images/wp-images/2021/03/test-site-02.png" alt="Test about page with .html showing" class="wp-image-4758" srcset="/assets/images/wp-images/2021/03/test-site-02.png 1000w, /assets/images/wp-images/2021/03/test-site-02-610x373.png 610w, /assets/images/wp-images/2021/03/test-site-02-768x469.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />  

Ahhhhh my eyes! ü§Æ Look at that horrible mess! `https://test.kq.md/about.html` is no good. The first solution for removing the HTML extension from the URL is simple &#8211; **put the page in a folder.**

## Solution 1 &#8211; Put pages in folders {#h-solution-1-put-pages-in-folders}

The test site I&#8217;ve made is currently flat and has no folder structure. So it looks like this:

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>|-- üìÑ index.html
|-- üìÑ about.html</code></pre>

In order to change `/about.html` to `/about` simply create a folder called `about`, move `about.html` into that folder and rename it to `index.html`. Once those changes are made, the new folder structure should look something like this:

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>|-- üìÑ index.html
|-- üìÅ about
     |-- üìÑ index.html</code></pre>

After making that change, let&#8217;s revisit the about page and see what&#8217;s happened to the URL:

<img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="609" src="/assets/images/wp-images/2021/03/test-site-03.png" alt="Test site with html extension removed" class="wp-image-4760" srcset="/assets/images/wp-images/2021/03/test-site-03.png 1000w, /assets/images/wp-images/2021/03/test-site-03-610x371.png 610w, /assets/images/wp-images/2021/03/test-site-03-768x468.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />  

Look at that URL, folks! There&#8217;s no file extension to be seen. Can we just bask in the glory of what we have accomplished for a second here please?

This is how many static site generators, [like Jekyll](https://kevq.uk/how-to-build-jekyll-site-simple-css/), generate their pages. Everything is in its own sub-folder and therefore have no file extensions in sight.

So, basking complete; we&#8217;re feeling good. Our mojo is strong and all is well in the world. Well, all is well if you only have a couple of pages on your website. What if you have a blog with tens, or even hundreds of pages? It may not be feasible to restructure your entire site to remove the HTML extension from your URLs.

## Solution 2 &#8211; remove the HTML extension with a .htaccess redirect {#h-solution-2-remove-the-html-extension-with-a-htaccess-redirect}

An alternative solution is to use your web server&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.htaccess" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">.htaccess</a> file in order to remove the file extension from the URL. This is done very simply in just a few lines of code:

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(&#91;^/]+)/$ $1.html
RewriteRule ^(&#91;^/]+)/(&#91;^/]+)/$ /$1/$2.html
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !(\.&#91;a-zA-Z0-9]{1,5}|/)$
RewriteRule (.*)$ /$1/ &#91;R=301,L]</code></pre>

What this snippet of code is doing, is stripping out `.html` from the URL path. It will also redirect anyone who visits a URL with `.html` appended to it, so you shouldn&#8217;t get any 404 errors if people visit the full URL.

## Conclusion {#h-conclusion}

That&#8217;s it, we&#8217;re done! With either of these solutions you should be able to remove the HTML extension from all of your URLs and rid yourself of all that ugliness.

Per [my disclaimer](https://kevq.uk/disclaimer/), this is just how I&#8217;ve managed to accomplish this myself. Do you have a better way? If so, please let me know.

If you&#8217;re hosting your site with Netlify, you could cut out this process completely and use their in-built option for removing file extensions. <a href="https://blog.mooreanalysis.com/extension-removal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This post by Ryan Moore</a> shows you how.
