I&#8217;ve seen a number of people adding a _uses_ page to their site. If you don&#8217;t know, a _uses_ page lists the hardware and software one uses regularly.

I&#8217;ve been thinking about doing one for a year or so now, but never got around to it. I&#8217;ve also been thinking about adding a <a href="https://nownownow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now page</a> too , but that&#8217;s one for another day.

Anyway, I read that <a href="https://bt.ht/sharing-the-things-we-use/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brad Taunt has created his own uses page</a>, so I decided to do the same. I&#8217;ll try to keep it up to date, but to be honest, my hardware and software don&#8217;t really change all that often, so I&#8217;m unlikely to need to change it much.

If you&#8217;re interested and want to take a look at what I use, [here&#8217;s a link to my uses page](https://kevquirk.com/uses/).
