**Hey there, fellow RSS lover. I owe you an apology.**

You may have noticed over the last day or so that my last 20 posts have re-appeared in your feed reader as fresh new content.

Yeah, sorry about that - it was all part of the work I've been doing to set my site up to have hidden RSS Club posts, like this one.

You see, while I was hacking on my site to set this whole thing up (post on how I did that coming soon), I had to make some changes to my RSS feed so that I could automate adding the _Pssst, this is RSS only..._ message at the top of RSS Club posts.

While I was there, I decided to add a _Reply via email_ link to all my feed items too, so that it matched my main site.

**Basically, I wanted to make reading my content via RSS a first-class citizen.**

Because I had to regenerate my RSS feed, some of your feed readers will have marked all my content as new, so I'm sorry about that.

I pinky promise that this is the last time I'll be pissing about with my RSS feed for a while - I'm happy with it now. ðŸ™ƒ
