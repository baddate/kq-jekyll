So remember a couple of days ago when I announced I would be [killing The Meta Letter](https://kevq.uk/notes/killing-the-meta-letter/)? Well, off the back of that announcement I received **TONNES** of requests (3 is tonnes, right?) to keep the newsletter alive as it was their only means of consuming my content.

Ok, it was more than 3, so I decided to keep the newsletter alive. Kind of. Previously I was using Sendy to manage the newsletter, it&#8217;s a great tool, but I didn&#8217;t want the hassle of maintaining the server and the domain reputation. So I&#8217;ve migrated to MailerLite so that those guys can worry about all that for me.

I won&#8217;t be sending any round up newsletters, like The Meta Letter was. I will simply be sending any posts that I publish to email subscribers too.

In the email about killing The Meta Letter, I recommended people subscribe via RSS, but many people don&#8217;t use RSS, so this seems like a good compromise. Plus, thanks to <a href="https://newsletterglue.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Newsletter Glue</a>, this is literally a single click when publishing a post. So I&#8217;m happy to oblige.

If you were subscribed to The Meta Letter, you will now be subscribed to the new newsletter, and should have received an email about all this. If the new newsletter is of no use because you read my content by other means, feel free to unsubscribe. No hard feelings. ðŸ™ƒ

In the meantime, I think this is a good way of ensuring the maximum amount of people continue to have access to my content.
