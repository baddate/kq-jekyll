  When I check my web analytics the response is often frustration, or even mild anxiety. I&#8217;m in a perpetual cycle of thinking <em>it&#8217;s not enough! </em>This obsession isn&#8217;t healthy, so what&#8217;s the point?
</p>

Picture the scene &#8211; I publish a new post on my blog and share it on social media. Maybe even [Hacker News and Lobste.rs](https://kevq.uk/notes/why-lobste-rs-is-better-than-hacker-news/) too. I leave things a few days, then check my analytics.

The post did fairly well. It garnered a 1,000 or so visits and my site is averaging thousands of visits every month. Life is good.

<img loading="lazy" width="1085" height="456" src="/assets/images/wp-images/2021/06/plausible-stats-jan-2021.png" alt="Plausible analytics example stats" class="wp-image-5891" srcset="/assets/images/wp-images/2021/06/plausible-stats-jan-2021.png 1085w, /assets/images/wp-images/2021/06/plausible-stats-jan-2021-610x256.png 610w, /assets/images/wp-images/2021/06/plausible-stats-jan-2021-768x323.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1085px) 100vw, 1085px" />  

But then I read a post that&#8217;s akin to _&#8220;How my post went viral and I got 20,000 new subscribers in a week!&#8221;_ I know they shouldn&#8217;t, but these posts really deflate me.

I start to ask myself why my post didn&#8217;t do better. Why did theirs do so well and my post only got 1,000 visits? Was it a bad post? Am I bad writer? Is the UX of my blog not up to scratch?

## The web analytics rabbit hole {#h-the-web-analytics-rabbit-hole}

At this point I head straight to my web analytics tool of choice, <a href="https://plausible.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plausible</a>, and start diving into my traffic. Instead of focussing on my successful posts, I immediately focus in on the posts that I feel aren&#8217;t doing well.

I then start searching for ways of improving engagement, improving my writing, just _improving._

<img loading="lazy" width="1088" height="437" src="/assets/images/wp-images/2021/06/plausible-stats-list-jan-2021.png" alt="Web analytics page statistics" class="wp-image-5896" srcset="/assets/images/wp-images/2021/06/plausible-stats-list-jan-2021.png 1088w, /assets/images/wp-images/2021/06/plausible-stats-list-jan-2021-610x245.png 610w, /assets/images/wp-images/2021/06/plausible-stats-list-jan-2021-768x308.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px" />  

The fact of the matter is, 10,000 visits in a month would be a bad month for me. And those 1,000 visits to my post is a lot of people. **That is successful!**

When I first started out, I wanted to get to 100 visits/month. Then it was 1,000. Then my approach flipped and I started looking at why my blog wasn&#8217;t performing as well as I wanted it to.

  But it was performing as well as I wanted it to!
</p>

It&#8217;s the same story with [my newsletter](https://kevq.uk/newsletter/). It has around 700 subscribers and <a href="https://metaletter.net/meta-letter-13-unlucky-for-some/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the last issue</a> had an open rate of approximately 37%. **_That&#8217;s rubbish!_** I thought. But the fact is, that&#8217;s really good, as the <a href="https://mailchimp.com/resources/email-marketing-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">average newsletter open rate is around 20%</a>.

## What can I do? {#h-what-can-i-do}

<a href="https://kevq.uk/notes/why-i-have-a-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I started this blog</a> because I enjoy writing. If anyone reads my drivel, that&#8217;s a bonus. I need to remember that.

So I&#8217;ve decided to go with the time tested mantra of _ignorance is bliss_. My Plausible Analytics subscription was due to renew in July. I won&#8217;t be doing that, in fact, **I&#8217;ve removed all analytics** from this site.

My hope is that by doing this, I won&#8217;t have the data available to go down the web analytics rabbit hole, even if I want to.

I must stress that I&#8217;m not unhappy with the service Plausible provides. They offer an amazing service that is a privacy respecting alternative to Google Analytics. The problem is me &#8211; I like numbers, but my compulsion with analytics isn&#8217;t healthy.

I&#8217;m probably going to unsubscribe from the &#8220;grow your blog&#8221; blogs I read. Honestly, most of them are spammy and I use very little of the advice they produce.

I&#8217;ll probably write an update at some point to let you folks know how I&#8217;m getting on without my precious analytics. My hope is that I&#8217;m more focussed on writing content and engaging with those people who [get in touch](https://kevq.uk/contact/) than worrying about whether I&#8217;m getting enough readers. I get more than enough readers!

**Do you have web analytics on your site? Please do let me know your thoughts on the topic &#8211; I&#8217;d love to hear other people&#8217;s opinion on this one.**
