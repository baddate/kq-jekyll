  I was reading a post on online conversations <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/online-conversations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Manu</a> last night, and the whole thing resonated with me. So I wanted to jot down my thoughts about online conversations and why I think it&#8217;s broken.

    I&#8217;ll keep saying it till the day I die, or until someone invents something better: <em>private conversations via email.</em> If you care about discussing something with someone, like genuinely care, try contacting them directly, in private, via email.

A couple of years ago, I removed all comments from this site. It&#8217;s a WordPress site, so enabling comments is trivial. However, I found that the vast majority of the comments I was getting were along the lines of this:

![](/assets/images/some-internet-guy-comment.png)   

If it wasn&#8217;t my pal _Some Internet Guy_ it was spam comments, usually about viagra, or sometimes trolls wishing me dead. Which is always nice. üòç

Luckily for me <a href="https://akismet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Akismet</a> caught most of the spam, but I still had to wade through _Some Internet Guy_ and his ilk&#8217;s useless comments on a daily basis.

## I still wanted online conversations {#h-i-still-wanted-online-conversations}

Problem was, despite all the useless comments, I still wanted the engagement from genuine readers, as that&#8217;s the main reason I write content. So I replaced the comment form with a simple button that said **Reply via email**, which linked to my email address.

<p class="notice">
  You can still find that button at the bottom of this (and every other) post on this site!
</p>

At first I wasn&#8217;t sure it would work. But a couple years on, I&#8217;m happy to report that it has. I&#8217;m sure I miss many useful comments, as a lot of people are less likely to send an email than write a comment. Mainly because there&#8217;s more involved in the latter, I think.

But that&#8217;s precisely why it _has_ worked (I think). You see, this very small barrier of having to click a button, compose an email and send it **just to me** means many don&#8217;t bother. Those that do aren&#8217;t looking for traffic to their site, like _Some Internet Guy_. They&#8217;re genuinely interested in the subject of the post, and just want to discuss it further.

I&#8217;ve had email conversations last weeks, and some people who have emailed me have kinda become friends off the back of it. I don&#8217;t think that would have happened if I was still using comments.

I emailed Manu after reading his post, and we had a nice little conversation. He checked out my posts and we had a short chat about some stuff on this blog that he had thoughts on. It was a great connection, as are many of the engagements I have as a result of people emailing me.

And don&#8217;t get me started on how much time it has saved me by not having to wade through useless comments every. Single. Day.

## Closing thoughts {#h-closing-thoughts}

I&#8217;m really happy I decided to remove comments from this site. If you have comments on your site, and you&#8217;re having similar problems to me (or if you&#8217;re using the [horrendous Disqus](https://kevquirk.com/commento-the-privacy-respecting-commenting-system/)) maybe consider doing the same?

I&#8217;m not saying it will definitely work for you, but it has for me, and it seems to have done the trick for Manu too.

**Are you all in on comments on your site? Or do you have nothing at all? Please do let me know your thoughts using the &#8212; you guessed it &#8212; email button below. üòÅ**
