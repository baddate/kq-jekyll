<p class="tldr">
  All of the kool kids in Twitter land seem to be jumping on the bandwagon of a very annoying craze. <strong>Twitter threads.</strong> Please stop; write a blog post instead.
</p>

As someone who has only really started using Twitter in the last few months (as I much prefer <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@kev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mastodon</a>) I've noticed that some people love nothing more than a good thread.

I assume it's because these people seem to get a tonne of followers off the back of these threads, thus perpetuating the whole thing and forcing more people onto that bandwagon.

## What is a Twitter thread? {#h-what-is-a-twitter-thread}

That's a fantastic question, dear reader. Basically, a Twitter thread is a collection of single Tweets that collectively make one story. It's common to have 10 or more Tweets in a single thread, but some times they get ridiculous.

For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1449525455988539394" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this thread</a> is **50 Tweets long**. Fifty. Tweets. Long!

## What's my problem with threads? {#h-what-s-my-problem-with-threads}

Anyone who regularly reads my content will know <a href="/my-history-with-blogging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I've been blogging for a long time</a>, so I'm always going to be bias. But the issue I really have with these blasted threads boils down to one thing. **Context.**

Using the example above, I became aware of it because someone that I follow re-tweeted Tweet number 47 in this ridiculously long thread. Because it was a random Tweet in a very long thread, I (and I imagine most other people reading the tweet) had absolutely no context as to what the whole saga was about.

### It isn't the right platform {#h-it-isn-t-the-right-platform}

Secondly, Twitter isn't the right platform for long-form content. If it was, it wouldn't have a 280 character limit. It's a micro blogging platform; and as we all know, _micro_ means small.

Surely a much better way of sharing long-form content would be to write a single coherent piece on a blog, then post a link to it on Twitter so your followers can read it in its entirety.

This also has the added benefit of decentralising content away from platforms like Twitter.

Yeah, I get it, most people don't have a blog, but <a href="/how-to-start-a-blog-if-youre-not-a-nerd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it's super simple</a> to start your one, or use a hosted provider, like <a href="https://wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WordPress</a>. So there's no excuse really.

I know some people on Twitter who post threads regularly. Why can't these long-form threads become posts on a blog? It would be easier for people to consume, they can still post it on Twitter, and it has the added benefit of potentially creating a whole new audience for the creator.

I've seen some really interesting threads on Twitter that are full of useful information, but as a consumer of that content, it's a nightmare to follow. Content creators should make content as simple to consume as possible.

## Closing thoughts {#h-closing-thoughts}

Maybe I'm just a dinosaur that needs to get with the times. If that's the case, I'll continue to die on this hill. I'd much rather own my content, and provide a coherent, easy to consume experience for my readers. Rather than trying to shoehorn a platform into submission just because it's the cool thing to do, or because it's the content creator's preferred platform.

I've tried posting a couple of Twitter threads myself, but both times I did it I found it awkward and confusing. Honestly, I don't get why people do it. For the likes? For the shares?
