<p class="tldr">
  All of the kool kids in Twitter land seem to be jumping on the bandwagon of a very annoying craze. <strong>Twitter threads.</strong> Please stop; write a blog post instead.
</p>

As someone who has only really started using <a href="https://twitter.com/kevquirk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> in the last few months (as I much prefer <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@kev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mastodon</a>) I&#8217;ve noticed that some people love nothing more than a good thread.

I assume it&#8217;s because these people seem to get a tonne of followers off the back of these threads, thus perpetuating the whole thing and forcing more people onto that bandwagon.

## What is a Twitter thread? {#h-what-is-a-twitter-thread}

That&#8217;s a fantastic question, dear reader. Basically, a Twitter thread is a collection of single Tweets that collectively make one story. It&#8217;s common to have 10 or more Tweets in a single thread, but some times they get ridiculous.

For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1449525455988539394" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this thread</a> is **50 Tweets long**. Fifty. Tweets. Long!

## What&#8217;s my problem with threads? {#h-what-s-my-problem-with-threads}

Anyone who regularly reads my content will know <a href="https://kevq.uk/my-history-with-blogging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I&#8217;ve been blogging for a long time</a>, so I&#8217;m always going to be bias. But the issue I really have with these blasted threads boils down to one thing. **Context.**

Using the example above, I became aware of it because someone that I follow re-tweeted Tweet number 47 in this ridiculously long thread. Because it was a random Tweet in a very long thread, I (and I imagine most other people reading the tweet) had absolutely no context as to what the whole saga was about.

### It isn&#8217;t the right platform {#h-it-isn-t-the-right-platform}

Secondly, Twitter isn&#8217;t the right platform for long-form content. If it was, it wouldn&#8217;t have a 280 character limit. It&#8217;s a micro blogging platform; and as we all know, _micro_ means small.

Surely a much better way of sharing long-form content would be to write a single coherent piece on a blog, then post a link to it on Twitter so your followers can read it in its entirety.

This also has the added benefit of decentralising content away from platforms like Twitter.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    But Kev, not everyone knows how to setup a blog!
  </p>
  
  <cite>Non-bloggers everywhere</cite>
</blockquote>

Yeah, I get it, most people don&#8217;t have a blog, but <a href="https://kevq.uk/how-to-start-a-blog-if-youre-not-a-nerd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it&#8217;s super simple</a> to start your one, or use a hosted provider, like <a href="https://wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WordPress</a>. So there&#8217;s no excuse really.

I know some people on Twitter who post threads regularly. Why can&#8217;t these long-form threads become posts on a blog? It would be easier for people to consume, they can still post it on Twitter, and it has the added benefit of potentially creating a whole new audience for the creator.

I&#8217;ve seen some really interesting threads on Twitter that are full of useful information, but as a consumer of that content, it&#8217;s a nightmare to follow. Content creators should make content as simple to consume as possible.

## Closing thoughts {#h-closing-thoughts}

Maybe I&#8217;m just a dinosaur that needs to get with the times. If that&#8217;s the case, I&#8217;ll continue to die on this hill. I&#8217;d much rather own my content, and provide a coherent, easy to consume experience for my readers. Rather than trying to shoehorn a platform into submission just because it&#8217;s the cool thing to do, or because it&#8217;s the content creator&#8217;s preferred platform.

I&#8217;ve tried posting a couple of Twitter threads myself, but both times I did it I found it awkward and confusing. Honestly, I don&#8217;t get why people do it. For the likes? For the shares?

**Help me out here folks. If you&#8217;re a serial threader, please help me to understand what I&#8217;m missing. You can get in touch below.**
