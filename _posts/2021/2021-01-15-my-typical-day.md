I&#8217;ve seen posts from a number of people describing what a typical day looks like for them. Before reading the posts, I thought a post about _My Typical Day_ would be mundane and uninteresting. But having a glimpse into how people work and stay productive is really interesting to me.

So, in case anyone has the same stalker mentality as myself, here&#8217;s what a typical working day looks like for me:

⏰ **06:30** &#8211; My alarm starts squawking and it&#8217;s time to get up (assuming the kids haven&#8217;t woken us up already).

🚿 **07:00** &#8211; Time to hop in the shower and get some of that stink off me!

☕ **07:20** &#8211; It&#8217;s coffee time!

🚗 **07:30** &#8211; If I&#8217;m working from home I&#8217;ll spend some time with my wife and kids before starting work. If I&#8217;m in the office, I hop in the car (or motorbike is it&#8217;s a nice day) and commute in.

🏢 **08:00** &#8211; I either head upstairs to my study, or by this time I&#8217;m in the office and ready to get cracking.

🤝 **08:30** &#8211; My first meeting is usually at 08:30, which is a handover from our team in Singapore.

📢 **09:00** &#8211; Is the InfoSec teams&#8217; standing meeting where we share what each team has been working on over the last day. It&#8217;s a great way to collaborate, debate risk and assess any potential business impacting issues.

🗣️ **09:30 &#8211; 12:00** &#8211; The rest of my morning tends to consist of a mixture of meetings with my various teams, 1:1 meetings (which are the most important meetings I attend), management meetings, or (God forbid) response bridges if we have a significant InfoSec issue that requires my input.

🍲 **12:00 &#8211; 13:00** &#8211; This is usually when I try to take lunch, but to be honest, that&#8217;s very rare. I usually just eat at my desk and multi-task.

🗣️ **13:00 &#8211; 16:00** &#8211; Since I work for Bank of America and I&#8217;m in the UK, my afternoons tend to be more meeting heavy. These meetings tend to be strategic and business focused.

🏠 **16:00 &#8211; 16:30** &#8211; Time to sign off, and if I&#8217;m working from the office, commute home. This can sometimes slip if there&#8217;s something urgent that needs my attention.

🍽 **17:00** &#8211; Family dinner. This is **very** important to us. We always try to ensure we have our dinner at the table, as a family. It&#8217;s a good time where we all catch up on the events of the day.

🛀 **18:00** &#8211; It&#8217;s bath-time for the kids, so they can wash their (much worse) stink off! My wife has usually had the kids for a fair proportion of the day by this point, so bath-time is my job.

🛌 **19:00** &#8211; Story and bed for the kids. My wife does one kid, I do other &#8211; we swap around daily.

🐕 **19:30** &#8211; I take the dog out for a walk. This is my time to relax, usually with a podcast or some music.

🛋 **20:30** &#8211; My wife and I have a cuppa (or a beer), we have our daily &#8220;parent de-brief&#8221; and usually watch some TV. Or, just sit and talk. If I need to, I catch up on work stuff here too.

🛏 **22:30** &#8211; Bedtime for my wife and I. We&#8217;re both usually knackered by this point, so we head off to bed ready to do it all again the next day!
