I&#8217;ve decided to do something a little different over the coming weeks and months. I&#8217;m going to start writing about some of the more amusing anecdotes from my past.

I&#8217;ve lived a varied life and I was an extremely accident prone kid, so I thought it would be fun to share some of the more interesting stories from my past.

Some will be from my childhood, others from adulthood and my time in the Army. All the stories are true.

I hope you enjoy these posts and that they give you a laugh. Be on the look out for the first post over the next couple of days, which is the story of when I was run over **twice on one day!**

Yes, I was that stupid&#8230;
