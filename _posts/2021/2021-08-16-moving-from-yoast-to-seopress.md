  So today I signed up for an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.seopress.org/pricing/" target="_blank">SEOPress Pro account</a> and migrated my site over to them from Yoast.
</p>

<p class="notice">
  Since writing this post, I&#8217;ve switched back to Yoast as the admin UI for SEO Press is just horrible to use. I&#8217;ll see how it goes with Yoast over the next few months and make a decision when my license is due to expire.
</p>

I did this because of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://yoast.com/exciting-news-yoast-joins-newfold-digital/" target="_blank">recent acquisition of Yoast by Newfold Digital</a>. If you don&#8217;t know, Newfold are a hosting company that own popular shared hosts like Bluehost and Hostgator.

The problem I have with the acquisition is that hosts like Bluehost and Hostgator have a well-earned reputation for providing a shitty hosting service that is fraught with vendor lock in.

Worst still, they often use <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.darkpatterns.org" target="_blank">Dark Patterns</a> to entice unsuspecting people in by offering discounts and outright lies with regards to the &#8220;excellent&#8221; performance.

Having used both Bluehost and Hostgator in the past, I can promise you that their server performance is shockingly bad, and their customer service is worse.

So I was sad to learn that Yoast &#8212; a company I&#8217;ve been a paid up member for for a couple of years now, and a plugin I&#8217;ve used for much longer than that &#8212; have decided to jump into bed with such a company.

## SEOPress {#h-seopress}

I&#8217;ve been thinking about moving away from Yoast for a while, but that was because of the price more than anything. The acquisition was the final straw though.

I previously tried RankMath, but <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kevquirk.com/migrating-from-yoast-to-rankmath-broke-my-site/" data-type="post" data-id="6236" target="_blank">that didn&#8217;t go too well</a>, so I abandoned that idea. Luckily for me I&#8217;ve had no such issues with SEOPress; the migration was seamless, there&#8217;s feature parity with Yoast and it&#8217;s a third of the price.

<p class="medium">
  Win / win / win.

Once I&#8217;ve found my feet with SEOPress, I&#8217;ll likely write about my thoughts on the plugin in a little more detail, but for now it seems like it was a good choice.
