  I’m sure most of you know what Tux is, but for the uninitiated, Tux is the unofficial Linux mascot and I <strong>HATE</strong> him.

Every time I see his stupid bloody face on a website, background image, or anywhere for that matter, it makes me cringe. Look at him, he’s ridiculous!

## Why I hate Tux {#h-why-i-hate-tux}

Now don’t get me wrong here, [I love Linux](/why-i-use-linux/), I just hate Tux. He’s a ridiculous mascot; he looks daft, he’s childish and honestly, I think he makes a mockery of Linux.

He’s so bad that when he was entered into 3 different Linux logo competitions, he didn’t win a single one. From Wikipedia:

> Tux was originally designed as a submission for a Linux&nbsp;logo&nbsp;contest. Three such competitions took place; Tux won none of them. This is why Tux is formally known as the Linux&nbsp;<em>brand character</em>&nbsp;and not the&nbsp;<em>logo</em>.

Look at it this way; say you’re exploring Linux for the first time, you look it up and see that stupid penguin staring back at you. Would you take the project seriously? I wouldn’t, and in fact, I didn’t for a long time because of Tux.

Eventually I decided to get over myself and try Linux, and I’m glad I did. But how many people has the community lost because of this? I dread to think.

Look, I get it, Tux is supposed to be a bit of fun. But it’s gotten to the point where Tux has become synonymous with Linux. I’m not trying to be a killjoy - I do think there is a place for Tux in Linux land. I just don’t think it should quite so prevalent.

## Is there another option? {#h-is-there-another-option}

Definitely. But I don’t know what that is. What I do know though, is that having a gormless looking penguin as the mascot for Linux isn’t the right call. To me, Tux is our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clippy</a>.

**What do you think? Am I being a killjoy here? Is Tux the right mascot for Linux? Feel free to let me know your thoughts…**
