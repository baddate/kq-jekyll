  I decided that I was sick of my site having no character, so I&#8217;ve made some changes to make it a bit more interesting.
</p>

I [recently posted about](https://kevq.uk/a-child-of-twenty-twenty-one/) using the default WordPress theme, <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twenty Twenty-One</a> on this site. While the default look of WordPress works really well, it&#8217;s too&#8230;boring. Here&#8217;s how it looked:

<img loading="lazy" width="1220" height="697" src="/assets/images/wp-images/2021/04/wp-2021-theme-1220x697.png" alt="WordPress twenty twenty-one theme on this site" class="wp-image-5023" srcset="/assets/images/wp-images/2021/04/wp-2021-theme-1220x697.png 1220w, /assets/images/wp-images/2021/04/wp-2021-theme-610x349.png 610w, /assets/images/wp-images/2021/04/wp-2021-theme-768x439.png 768w, /assets/images/wp-images/2021/04/wp-2021-theme.png 1349w" sizes="(max-width: 1220px) 100vw, 1220px" />  

I&#8217;ve posted a number of times about how I want to stop pissing about with my site&#8217;s code and just write content. But I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about that lately, and something dawned on me&#8230;

<p class="has-medium-font-size">
  I like pissing about with my site&#8217;s code!
</p>

It&#8217;s the precursor for a lot of the content on this site. Plus, I really enjoy learning new stuff about web design and all the cool things you can do with it.

## My playground {#h-my-playground}

I&#8217;ve decided that I should stop trying to fool myself. This site is my playground. It doesn&#8217;t need to look like a Medium blog &#8211; I can do what I like with it. If I want to make it bright pink and yellow, why the hell not, dear reader?

So around a week ago I started building a new theme and what you&#8217;re looking at now is the result. It&#8217;s far from finished, and things will change. But it&#8217;s allowing me to have fun and express myself a little.

I may decide that &#8220;melting borders&#8221; aren&#8217;t for me in a few weeks, or that I want to change the colour scheme from dark grey and blue (or orange if you&#8217;re in <a href="https://kevq.uk/how-to-add-css-dark-mode-to-a-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dark mode</a>) to something completely mental.

<p class="notice">
  <strong>Update from the future</strong>: yep, it&#8217;s 1 day later and I&#8217;ve got rid of the &#8220;melting borders&#8221; I didn&#8217;t really like them &#8211; they felt tacky.
</p>

WordPress may fall by the wayside and I may flip back to a static site generator, like <a href="https://kevq.uk/how-to-build-jekyll-site-simple-css/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jekyll</a>. Or something else entirely.

Fact is, I feel like the flood gates have opened on my creativity and it&#8217;s liberating. I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;ve held back for so long &#8211; it&#8217;s fun! If I go too far and completely mess up the reading experience, there&#8217;s always reader mode in your browser. ðŸ˜€

## What&#8217;s changed? {#h-what-s-changed}

Well, lots. There&#8217;s a new theme, but with the same colour scheme. I&#8217;ve re-introduced some web fonts to make things a little more interesting.

<s>I&#8217;ve also added some SVG paths between the header and footer to make things more&#8230;&#8221;interesting&#8221;.</s>

You may hate the new design, and that&#8217;s fine. Because I really like it, and it&#8217;s my site, so that&#8217;s all that matters right?
