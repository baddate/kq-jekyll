  I decided that I was sick of my site having no character, so I&#8217;ve made some changes to make it a bit more interesting.
</p>

I [recently posted about](/a-child-of-twenty-twenty-one/) using the default WordPress theme, <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twenty Twenty-One</a> on this site. While the default look of WordPress works really well, it's too&#8230;boring. Here's how it looked:

I've posted a number of times about how I want to stop pissing about with my site's code and just write content. But I've been thinking a lot about that lately, and something dawned on me&#8230;

<p class="medium">
  I like pissing about with my site's code!
</p>

It's the precursor for a lot of the content on this site. Plus, I really enjoy learning new stuff about web design and all the cool things you can do with it.

## My playground {#h-my-playground}

I've decided that I should stop trying to fool myself. This site is my playground. It doesn't need to look like a Medium blog - I can do what I like with it. If I want to make it bright pink and yellow, why the hell not, dear reader?

So around a week ago I started building a new theme and what you're looking at now is the result. It's far from finished, and things will change. But it's allowing me to have fun and express myself a little.

I may decide that &#8220;melting borders&#8221; aren't for me in a few weeks, or that I want to change the colour scheme from dark grey and blue (or orange if you're in <a href="/how-to-add-css-dark-mode-to-a-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dark mode</a>) to something completely mental.

<p class="notice">
  <strong>Update from the future</strong>: yep, it's 1 day later and I've got rid of the &#8220;melting borders&#8221; I didn't really like them - they felt tacky.
</p>

WordPress may fall by the wayside and I may flip back to a static site generator, like <a href="/how-to-build-jekyll-site-simple-css/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jekyll</a>. Or something else entirely.

Fact is, I feel like the flood gates have opened on my creativity and it's liberating. I don't know why I've held back for so long - it's fun! If I go too far and completely mess up the reading experience, there's always reader mode in your browser. ðŸ˜€

## What's changed? {#h-what-s-changed}

Well, lots. There's a new theme, but with the same colour scheme. I've re-introduced some web fonts to make things a little more interesting.

<s>I've also added some SVG paths between the header and footer to make things more&#8230;&#8221;interesting&#8221;.</s>

You may hate the new design, and that's fine. Because I really like it, and it's my site, so that's all that matters right?
