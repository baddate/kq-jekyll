  I hear lots of people in the Linux community say that Windows is really unstable, but how unstable is it really? Here&#8217;s my opinion on the matter&#8230;
</p>

I asked the community over on <a href="https://fosstodon.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fosstodon</a> what they thought about the stability of Windows. I was expecting a lot of responses, but goodness me, there were LOADS of them! You can <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@kev/106230198389675398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read the entire thread here</a>.

Even though there were a tonne of responses, **most** of them fell into one of the following issues:

  1. Blue screen of death (BSOD)
  2. Updates randomly rebooting the machine
  3. Poor performance
  4. Bad <a href="https://kevq.uk/category/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy</a> practices
  5. Bundled software

Some of these I agree with, but not all of them. A few of them don&#8217;t actually relate to the stability of Windows at all. So I wanted to spend a bit of time writing out my thoughts on whether Windows is actually stable or not.

## Is Windows _actually_ unstable? {#h-is-windows-actually-unstable}

So looking at those 5 buckets again, it&#8217;s only really BSOD and the updates that pertain to the stability of Windows, **in my opinion**. Yes, the others are problems, but they don&#8217;t affect the stability of the OS.

Personally, I think the feedback around updates rebooting the machine automatically and BSOD is quite outdated. Probably as a result of many of the people providing feedback being Linux users for a long time. Or, dare I say it, a certain level of bandwagonsim maybe?

### Blue screen of death {#h-blue-screen-of-death}

This is purely anecdotal, as I can only draw on my own experience, **but I don&#8217;t remember the last time I saw a Windows 10 BSOD.** I have a Windows 10 installation on my desktop computer, and my Wife&#8217;s laptop runs Windows 10 too. I&#8217;ve never seen either of them BSOD. **Not a single time.**

Further, I also have Windows 10 on my work laptop, and my work virtual desktop. Plus, all of the machines in work run Windows 10 too. There&#8217;s hundreds of them in my office and I have **never** seen a BSOD on anyone&#8217;s machine. I&#8217;ve never even heard someone complain about it.

<p class="medium">
  Surely if the BSOD was as prevalent as the Linux community makes out, we would hear Windows users shouting about it at least some of the time?
</p>

### Updates causing a reboot {#h-updates-causing-a-reboot}

Again, I&#8217;ve simply not experienced this. Now, back in the Windows 2000/XP days, yeah I think we all experienced this. However, for **many** years now, I&#8217;ve not seen this happen.

The user experience I&#8217;ve had is a notification to say that there are updates pending, then a little orange bubble on the shut down icon to remind me that I need to reboot to install updates.

Again, if this was a common as the Linux community makes out, how would anyone on Windows get any work done?

### Poor performance {#h-poor-performance}

Let me say this first &#8211; poor performance doesn&#8217;t mean that Windows is unstable. That aside, I don&#8217;t think Windows 10 actually performs poorly.

I&#8217;m in the privileged position to have a <a href="https://kevq.uk/upgrading-my-desktop-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relatively powerful desktop</a>, but I have to say I don&#8217;t notice any performance difference between Linux (I&#8217;m currently running Kubuntu 20.04) and Windows 10.

Windows 10 is certainly more RAM hungry than Linux though. For example, I&#8217;m currently running at around 8GB RAM used, whereas on Linux, running similar applications is around 6GB RAM.

But using more RAM doesn&#8217;t equate to poor performance unless you&#8217;re actually running out of RAM. I have 32GB RAM on my desktop, so I&#8217;m good with 8GB RAM being used. Overall, Windows performs just as well as Linux for me.

### Bad privacy & bundled software {#h-bad-privacy-bundled-software}

While I agree with this wholeheartedly, once again it doesn&#8217;t equate to instability in Windows. There are <a href="https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/windows-privacy-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">things you can do to make Windows 10 more private</a>, and I **strongly** recommend you do them if you&#8217;re running Windows 10.

Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;ve found to get rid of all the rubbish software that Microsoft bundle in, other than perusing the add/remove programs screen after the OS has been installed.

Very annoying.

Linux isn&#8217;t innocent of this though either. A lot of distributions bundle a number of software applications that I don&#8217;t use. Luckily for me though, the Ubuntu devs have solved this for me by offering a minimal install option.

If only Microsoft did the same&#8230;

## I don&#8217;t think Windows is unstable

Yes, Windows has its problems. But in my experience (and I must stress again &#8211; this is all based on just my own experience) Windows 10 is **not** unstable.

In fact, I would go one further and say that Windows 10 is actually a really good operating system. Once you&#8217;ve sorted the privacy concerns and uninstalled all the junk.

I use Windows 10 on my desktop 90% of the time now, mainly because I can&#8217;t connect to my corporate network in Linux. Because of this, I&#8217;ve built a pretty solid workflow in Windows 10 and, much like Linux, it just gets out of my way.

Also, Windows 10 is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/7/8568473/windows-10-last-version-of-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty much a rolling release</a>, so I&#8217;m unlikely to need to reinstall any time soon. Bearing all this in mind, I&#8217;m seriously thinking about ditching the Kubuntu 20.04 installation from my desktop and just having Windows 10. I will continue to use Linux on my trusty ThinkPad, however.

**Have you ditched Linux in favour of Windows? Do you think Windows is unstable? I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts**.
