Hey there folks. If you&#8217;re subscribed to <a href="https://metaletter.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my newsletter</a>, you probably heard that I&#8217;m super busy at the moment. So I&#8217;ve been thinking about how I can reduce my workload when I&#8217;m outside of work so I can focus on producing content.

As you may know, I have a number of mini-projects, including <a href="https://simplecss.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SimpleCSS</a>, <a href="https://512kb.club" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">512KB Club</a> and <a href="https://100daystooffload.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100 Days To Offload</a>. I need to reduce some of this, but I don&#8217;t want to kill any of them either.

The 512KB Club is the one that takes most of my time, because people submit their sites, I have to review them, add them to the list, then commit the changes. Doesn&#8217;t sound much, but when there&#8217;s 20 a week, it can take some time!

## I&#8217;d like some help! {#h-i-d-like-some-help}

If you&#8217;re interested in helping with adding sites to the project, please [get in touch](https://kevq.uk/contact/). I&#8217;d like someone (or more than one person) to assist in reviewing any sites that are added, and adding them to the 512KB Club.

**If you&#8217;re interested in helping, you should be familiar with the following:**

  * Git & GitHub
  * YAML
  * Jekyll

I&#8217;m not expecting anyone to step forward, so please don&#8217;t feel obliged to. But if no one does volunteer, I may need to do a Google and shut down the 512KB Club. ðŸ˜¢

<p class="notice">
  I&#8217;ve had lots of very kind offers and now have a couple of people helping with the project. Thanks to everyone who contacted me about this!
