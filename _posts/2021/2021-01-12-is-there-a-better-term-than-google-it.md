I&#8217;m a proud privacy advocate. I have [de-Googled where possible](/categories/#De-Googling); I&#8217;m using [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) for search, Zoho for email and a raft of other products instead of Google&#8217;s offering.

But I still use the term _&#8220;Google it&#8221;_ when referring to search.

â€¦and I think most other people do too.

## What&#8217;s the alternative? {#h-what-s-the-alternative}

I could say _&#8220;DuckDuckGo it&#8221;_ but most people would have no idea what I&#8217;m talking about, plus it doesn&#8217;t role off the tongue very nicely.

Using _&#8220;search for it&#8221;_ is non-contextual. **Search for it where?** In the drawer? Under the bed? What does _&#8220;search for it&#8221;_ mean?

I&#8217;d prefer not to use the term _&#8220;Google it&#8221;_ for obvious reasons. So, fellow privacy advocates, what&#8217;s the alternative term for _&#8220;Google it&#8221;_?

**If you have any ideas, feel free to [sign my guestbook](/guestbook) or [contact me](/contact).**

  After <strong>LOTS</strong> of feedback <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@kev/105542170312601751">on Fosstodon</a> I&#8217;ve decided to go with &#8220;look it up&#8221; because it&#8217;s still 3 syllables and rolls off the tongue nicely.
