  I ❤️ <a href="https://xiu.io/posts/20-the-case-against-signal/">The Case Against Signal</a> by Guillaume Hérail
</p>

There have been a lot of naysayers recently around [Signal](https://signal.org), it&#8217;s use of cloud providers, as well as a number of other &#8216;issues&#8217; with their service.

In this post, Guillaume articulates the arguments **for** Signal in a way I very much agree with. Well worth a read no matter which side of the Signal fence you&#8217;re on.

    With WhatsApp changing its privacy policy, Signal has been getting a lot of attention over the past few days. While a lot of praise has been given to the project, a lot of critiques emerged as well. I wanted to review some of the arguments that were mentioned and explain why, to me, these arguments were not enough to discard Signal as an option.
