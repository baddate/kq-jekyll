Well, I’ve been a busy guy re-designing my personal homepage. What do you guys think of it? I personally think it’s pretty awesome. ![:)](https://web.archive.org/web/20130707182343im_/http://kevquirk.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

So now, instead of having just a simple “vcard” website, I’ve got a blog, portfolio and a few other bits and bobs. So in this blog I will be mostly writing about my own personal thoughts, or things I am interested in. So please don’t be offended as they are my opinions only. I hope you enjoy your visit and please feel free to drop me a message to provide some feedback on the site.

Thanks!

Kev
