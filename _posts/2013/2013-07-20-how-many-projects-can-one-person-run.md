I really love blogging and I’m always on the look out for a new and exciting project to sink my teeth into. But I have to be honest with myself a lot of the time – I usually don’t have the time to take on any more projects.

I obviously run this site, but having a personal site I think is extremely important for anyone nowadays, and even more so for those of us in the IT industry. As well as this site I also run my technology blog [RefuGeeks](https://web.archive.org/web/20131215172915/http://refugeeks.com/), I have a full time job, a successful yet very small web design business and I try to fit in [FOSS Advocates](https://web.archive.org/web/20131215172915/http://fossadvocates.org/) whenever I get time (we could do with some help on FOSS advocates by the way if anyone is interested).

I’ve now had an idea for yet another blog, it’s technology based but *extremely* specific. It’s a real niche and would be one of, if not *the* first blog of it’s kind. But I just don’t know if I have the time or the inclination to take on yet another project.

**So I ask you guys, how many projects is too many? Am I taking on too much, should I leave this new project well alone? I just don’t know…it’s seems that [domains aren’t the only thing I’m addicted to](https://web.archive.org/web/20131215172915/http://kevquirk.com/2013/06/my-name-is-kev-quirk-and-im-an-addict/)!**
