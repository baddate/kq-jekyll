{{ page.description }} Here's some stats from the last 10 years, as well as some lessons I've learned along the way...

When I started drafting up this post, I thought it would be a good idea to have some stats, so I went away and typed up some liquid (as this blog is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)) to show those stats.

Then, I decided it would be cool to have ongoing stats as the blog grows, so I've added a [stats page](/stats/) for us all to enjoy. To save you the trouble of navigating away from this page, here's some high level stats...

{: .notice}
If you're running a Jekyll based blog and want similar stats on your site, you can [find my source code here](https://github.com/kevquirk/kq-jekyll/blob/main/stats.md).

## The stats

**Total posts:** 300<br>
**Total words:** 250,312 (thatâ€™s approximately 5 novels)<br>
**Average words per post:** 834<br>
**Total [categories](/categories/):** 15

**Posts by year:**

- 2023 - 4
- 2022 - 60
- 2021 - 60
- 2020 - 86
- 2019 - 23
- 2018 - 20
- 2017 - 12
- 2016 - 2
- 2015 - 8
- 2014 - 8
- 2013 - 17

So I've written over a quarter of a million words so far, which is the equivalent of 5 novels apparently. Ironically, this is also my 300th post - I didn't plan that.

I'm disappointed that my output was so low between 2014 - 2016. I had a lot going on in my personal life around that time though, so I'm not really surprised. It's still a shame, though.

It seems my most active year was 2020, with 83 posts, but I've continued to keep the tempo to a similar level in 2021 and 2022, where I averaged 5 posts a month.

I think 5 posts per month is pretty good, but it's also the reason why I've never been able to complete the [100 Days to Offload challenge](https://100daystooffload.com). Who knows, maybe I'll do it this year?

Overall, I think maintaining a regular cadence of posting, and managing to produce 300 posts in a 10 year period is pretty darn good. 

## What I've learned

The last 10 years has taught me a lot. I think my writing style has improved somewhat, as has my written English (something I was always *really* bad at). But I've also learned a lot about managing a blog.

Before I [removed all analytics from this website](https://kevquirk.com/revisiting-the-web-analytics-rabbit-hole/), I was getting around 500,000 visits a month. In my opinion that's *a lot* of visits. Even if that number has dropped since then, it's still way more successful than I'd ever hoped.

If you read a lot of the *"how to start a blog in 2023"* type posts (please don't *ever* use that title in a post) the advice will often boil down to something like:

* Choose a niche
* Start collecting email addresses *immediately* (newsletter)
* Write on a regular schedule

I don't do any of those things. ðŸ˜‚

I write about [tech](https://kevquirk.com/category/technology/), [opinions](https://kevquirk.com/category/opinion/), [fish keeping](https://kevquirk.com/category/fish-keeping/), [web design](https://kevquirk.com/category/web/); I even tell [stories](https://kevquirk.com/category/story-time/). I think the only niche I have, is not having a bloody niche!

I don't collect email addresses -- although I did do it for a while, it became too much of a [headache to manage](https://kevquirk.com/killing-the-meta-letter/) -- and I write whenever I feel like writing.

The biggest lesson I've learned from 10 years of blogging is this...

{: .medium}
**Enjoy what you write about, otherwise, what's the point?**

Write a post when the feeling takes you; sometimes I don't write for weeks, other times I'll write multiple posts in a few days.

Don't limit yourself to a single niche. Write about what interests you. When I read blogs, especially personal blogs, I like to learn about the person as whole, not just one particular skill they have.

## Final thoughts

It's been a fantastic 10 years of writing/blogging. This blog has gone from strength to strength and I'm still enjoying it today, just as much as I did on [day one](https://kevquirk.com/welcome-to-my-new-site/).

The above isn't the perfect formula to running a blog, far from it. Had I followed some of the advice in those *"how to start a blog..."* posts, maybe this site would be far more successful now, who knows?

But who cares. I've had fun along the way, I have [lots of engagement](https://kevquirk.com/online-conversations-website-engagement/), and I'll continue write while it's still fun.

Here's to the next 10 years, folks!
