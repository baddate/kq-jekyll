Yes, you read that right. **I've decided to re-join Twitter.** There's a lot of stuff I miss from the social network - the community, the threads, the hot takes. the *fun*.

I feel like Mastodon is becoming way too serious...it needs more of those fun-time Twitter folk. Because I intend for Twitter to be my primary social network, I'm thinking about putting my Mastodon profile out to pasture too.

But what lead me to these decisions? Well dear reader, that's a looooong story. So I decided to do a video about it instead of writing War and Peace.
