*The Wise Man's Fear* and to a lesser extent, *[The Name Of The Wind](https://kevquirk.com/the-name-of-the-wind/)*, are frustratingly brilliant. Both are part of Patrick Rothfuss' *Kingkiller Chronicle*. A trilogy of books that follow the story of Kvothe, a famous and powerful magician that seems to have had a fall from grace and is now a humble innkeeper.

Kvothe is telling his story to a scribe; book 1 follows the first day of that storytelling, and this, book 2, follows day 2. It's a long book, but because of it Rothfuss is able to really develop a lot of depth the to characters and storylines.

The problem is, there's a lot of rumour online that Rothfuss will never finish the trilogy. Considering it's been over 10 years since *The Wise Man's Fear* was released and there's still no sniff of book 3, I'm inclined agree.

Despite this, the existing two books are still well worth a read in their own right. I'd love to see Rothfuss finish the trilogy, but even if he doesn't, I'm still happy I read these books.

This was a fantastic book that I thoroughly enjoyed. It has an epic storyline that covers a hell of a lot. Five stars from me.

**Go read it!**
