So many people have reached out with messages of support following my "Fat Boy" post. I'm thinking maybe we should start a little mailing list?


Since I wrote the [Fat Boy at 40](https://kevquirk.com/fat-boy-at-40) post a few days ago, *so many* people have reached out to offer their stories, advice and support.

It's been overwhelming how many people have emailed, so thanks to everyone that did.

Anyway, a few of those people are going through similar processes as myself, which got me to thinking...

**What about setting up a little mailing list that we can all use to share ideas, spur each other on, and/or hold each other accountable.**

If we do it, I'd like to keep it simple and use email, because everyone has an email address and it works well. I've never managed a mailing list though, so I'm open to advice/ideas.

I dunno, might be a stupid idea, but if you think it could be of use, get in touch using the button below.
