I've been staring at a blank box for a little bit now, trying to work out what to write. This has never happened to me before. I think I know why... 


I do enjoy the process of writing. I fire up my text editor of choice, [Typora](https://typora.io) and away I go. Most of the time I have a topic in my grey matter that I want to write about, and if I don't, something usually comes to me pretty quickly. Which topics to cover aren't something I usually dwell on.

Today I feel like writing, but I have nothing to write about. I've been staring at Typora's abyssal blank screen for a little while now, but my grey matter remains as abyssal as the screen I'm staring at.

## But why?

I think I know why - a lot of my inspiration comes from stuff I see and read on the Internet.

The thing is, [I haven't been enjoying the Internet lately](https://kevquirk.com/anti-social-update), so I haven't been spending much time on it. Summer is here, the weather is beautiful, and I'm very lucky to live in a 2.5 acre smallholding. So most of my free time has been taken up with that.

We've been cutting back trees, planting hedgerows, creating a vegetable patch and setting up a chicken coop. Aside from all this, I've been servicing my motorbikes and our mower, as well as doing some DIY around the house.

It has been magnificent.

So yes, I may be staring at a lifeless, colourless, blank box that's ready to churn through my mundane ramblings; but my life is more varied, more colourful and more full than ever.

So yeah, I haven't been spending much time online, but I *have* been living my life instead. All things considered, I think that's the best possible reason not to have anything to write about, right?

## What does this mean for this site?

In short, absolutely nothing. I still enjoy writing, and technology is still a significant hobby of mine. But I may end up writing about more varied topics on this blog than just tech.

Maybe some stuff about the work we're doing at home? What we're growing etc? This is a *personal* blog, after all.
