Weâ€™ve been having some challenges over on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org) recently. Between availability issues thanks to [large influxes of users](https://hub.fosstodon.org/more-upgrades-twitter-storm/), technology problems and DDoS attacks, itâ€™s been a fun few months.

Problem is, when Fosstodon is down, I have no presence on the Fediverse, so we canâ€™t inform people as to whatâ€™s going on. With that in mind, Iâ€™d like to setup an alternate account on the Fedi for me to use. Plus, it also allows me to post about my other hobbies outside of tech; like fish keeping, motorbikes, home steading etc.

My default was to open another Mastodon server with the **amazing** [Masto.host](https://masto.host), but I quickly realised that if they have a technology issue, it could take down both my instances.

I needed to decentralise. (see what I did there? ðŸ˜‰)

I tried a self-hosted Akkoma server for a few days, but the headaches of managing a server became apparent, so Iâ€™ve killed that too. So what was I to do? Well...

## Micro.blog

Since writing about [how confusing Micro.blog is](https://kevquirk.com/micro-blog-is-still-confusing/) recently, Iâ€™ve decided to make a longer term go of it. And since Micro.blog now supports the Fediverse, it seemed like a potential contender. Itâ€™s not been without itâ€™s frustrations - I stand by my comments that itâ€™s *extremely* confusing to use, but Iâ€™m getting there with it.

Thereâ€™s also the cross-posting service they have, which may be useful in the future. I dunno. So I think for now Iâ€™m going to stick with Micro.blog as my other place on the Fediverse, so if you wanna follow me over there, please feel free. Hereâ€™s some links:

* [Follow me on Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/kq)
* [Follow my Micro.blog account on the Fedi](https://micro.blog/kq?remote_follow=1) (or search for @kev@qrk.social)
* [Follow me on Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@kev)

Micro.blog uses RSS as a first-class citizen too ([thatâ€™s really important to me](https://kevquirk.com/please-add-rss-support-to-your-site/)) so if you prefer to just follow my microblog via RSS, you can do that too. Links are in the footer of my [microblog site](https://qrk.social).

As I get more comfortable with Micro.blog, Iâ€™ll write a more in-depth opinion piece on whether my position on their service has changed. Until then, Iâ€™ll continue chugging along on both. Micro.blog and Fosstodon.
