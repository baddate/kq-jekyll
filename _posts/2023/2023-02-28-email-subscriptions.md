A while ago, back in 2021 in fact, [I maintained a newsletter](https://kevquirk.com/evolving-my-newsletter/). But after some time I realised that [newsletters are hard work](https://kevquirk.com/why-are-newsletters-so-painful/), so I decided to ditch the whole idea.

Since then, a number of people have emailed me asking if I still offer a way for people to subscribe via email, but I don't. Well, not until today at least.

[Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) have implemented a load of new features since the last time I tried their service. Chief among them is the ability to ingest an RSS feed as newsletter posts.

This means that I can ingest [my RSS feed](https://kevquirk.com/feed/) into Buttondown, which can then be configured to either send the item automatically, or create a draft. So I've signed up for a Buttondown account and added a form to the bottom of all my posts. If you wish to sign-up, please feel free.

{: .notice}
**Note:** this is a trial at the moment. Having worked really hard on [my publishing workflow](https://kevquirk.com/my-static-site-workflow/), I want to ensure things remain easy for me to manage. But I also want to ensure folk have the ability to consume my content in the way that makes the most sense to them.

After running tests for a couple weeks, I think it's going to be as easy as quickly reviewing the auto-draft in Buttondown, then sending it out. Then, once I get more confidence, I'll probably flip the switch and have Buttondown send the posts automatically.

With this process being very low friction for me, I'm confident the _subscribe by email_ function will stick around. So if you prefer to get this kinda thing by email, please feel free to make use of the form below and subscribe.

## Final point

I want to end by reassuring you that if you do sign up, it will literally just be my posts that you receive to your inbox. There will be no tracking, no affiliate links, no other newsletter bullshit. And, of course, you can subscribe at any time - all emails you receive will have an unsubscribe link that _actually_ works.

This is nothing more than a way for you to read my content via email.
