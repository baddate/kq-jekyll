{{ page.description }}

A few days ago I wrote about how I'd [spun up a self-hosted Microblog](https://kevquirk.com/self-hosted-microblog/) in favour of using the [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) service. Since then -- just a few days later, might I add -- I decided to flip back to Micro.blog.

Micro.blog does 90% of what I want it to do, and to be honest, even getting to that point is bloody difficult when you consider things like ActivityPub support, Webmentions, cross-posting, ease of creating posts etc.

I was trying to fit a square peg into a round hole with WordPress. So I went back to Micro.blog. Yes, [the service is confusing](https://kevquirk.com/micro-blog-is-still-confusing/), but it's *very* good. All in all, Micro.blog is *good enough* and I'm happy.

## But is good enough, good enough?

I'm happy with my decision around my Microblog, but researching all the options available to me sent me down a familiar rabbit hole - I started considering whether Jekyll is the best tool for this blog or not?

At this point, I've built [a pretty good workflow with Jekyll](https://kevquirk.com/my-static-site-workflow/) and overall I'm happy producing my posts with it. There have, however, been a number of times where I've had trouble with my local install of Jekyll. Inevitably something updates on my Mac, the Ruby stack shits the bed and I have to go hunting for a solution.

I usually find a solution, and things start chugging away nicely again, but it would be nice if I didn't have to do that from time to time. Jekyll isn't perfect, but once again, it's *good enough*.

## Then came Jack...

So I'm already in this frame of mind where I'm considering other options for my blog. It's just a thing I do at this point; the constant hunt for perfection-- [my blogging utopia](https://kevquirk.com/my-blogging-utopia/) -- is like a perpetual motion engine in my brain. It wont bloody stop.

Anyway, I came across [this post by Jack Baty](https://baty.net/2023/blot-is-just-right) (for those that don't know, Jack is just as bad as me for changing blogging platforms ðŸ™ƒ). In this post he talks about a switch from WordPress to [Blot](https://blot.im). He says:

> Blot is like an SSG but without all the dependencies and fuss. Put some Markdown (or HTML or Text) files in a Dropbox folder and boom, a nice blog appears.

Needless to say this piqued my interest. Here I am with a *good enough* tool in Jekyll, where the only real problems I have are when Ruby has a brain fart. Could Blot be the solution, or is *good enough*...good enough?

I'm already familiar with Blot, as I'm an avid reader of Nicolas Magand's most excellent blog, [The Jolly Teapot](https://thejollyteapot.com). He's been using it with great success for quite some time.

Blot would allow me to write in plain text, just like I do now, then dump it into a folder and forget about it. Blot would do the rest and I wouldn't have to worry about Ruby having a meltdown the next time my Mac updates.

I dunno, maybe there's something to this?...or maybe, just maybe, *good enough* is, you know...good enough.

**What do you think?**
