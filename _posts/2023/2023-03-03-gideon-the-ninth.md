I was really looking forward to *Gideon The Ninth* having read lots of glowing reviews about the book, and the series in general, but I came away feeling a bit...*meh*.

It's not a *bad* book, don't get me wrong, but I don't think it lived up to the hype. The story is really interesting, and quite unique, what with the necromancy and all that, but I don't think Muir went into enough detail about the background story.

Personally, I would have preferred this book to have set the scene a little better and talk about the background of the empire we find ourselves in, the Emperor, and how it all came to be.

Instead, I found myself playing catch up on the storyline and feeling unfulfilled because of it. Despite this, I found Gideon to be absolutely brilliant and really well written. There was just enough dark humour sprinkled in to make me chuckle a number of times.

I found my brain wandering at times, which isn't a great sign, but in fairness to the book, I "read" this via audiobook and this was my first one, so maybe that had something to do with it?

  <summary>ðŸš¨ Mild spoiler ahead...</summary>
  <p>The last few chapters culminate into what can only be described as a boss fight, and they're really gripping as the story all comes together. But like I said, I'd have liked the backstory to have been revealed a sooner.</p>

Given how the first book ended, I think I will read the second book, but I might try this the old fashioned way, by *actually reading it* to see if that holds my attention any better.

In the meantime, I flipped back to Brandon Sanderson's world and am currently ~~reading~~ listening to *The Way Of The Kings*.
