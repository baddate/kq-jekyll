I love my Crocs. I have 3 pairs, and in this post I'm going to convince you that they're the best shoes on earth.


Yes yes yes, I've heard it all before ***"the holes in Crocs are where your dignity leaks out."*** But the fact is, they're really bloody comfortable, and good for your feet too, apparently.

Around 8 years ago, I was really struggling with [plantar fasciitis](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/plantar-fasciitis/). I'd get up in the morning and could barely walk, it was so painful. So, I went to see the Doc, who recommended I try Crocs. My response was something like:

> They're horrible and I'm not an old man

But after thinking about it, and looking at them online, they only cost like Â£40, so I decided it was worth a punt.

A day later they arrived, I slipped them on and it was like heaven on earth! They're nice and wide, so your feet have plenty of room to breath and stretch out. They're also *so* comfortable and they have really good arch support.

I rarely had them off my feet, and they were quickly worn ragged. So they were demoted to "my outdoor Crocs" and I bought another pair for in the house. This second pair also wore out after a few years, so I bought a *third* pair.

I now have a pair for in the house, a pair by the back door, and a pair by the side door, both for outside. If I'm in or around the house, you can bet I'll be wearing Crocs.

*All the Crocs*

## Then COVID hit

Like many people, I was at home a lot more during COVID, so my mum bought me a pair of nice suede slippers for my birthday. Being the dutiful son that I am, I replaced my trusty Crocs with the slippers.

Because I was at home all the time, my slippers got a lot of wear, and over the course of a few months, I notice the pain in my feet returning. I thought nothing of it and just got on with things, but over the period of 6 months or so, the pain returned to the point it was at before - I could barely walk when I woke up again.

**Then it dawned on me...**

> Jen, it's my Crocs. I haven't been wearing my Crocs!

...is what I exclaimed to my wife. Her response was something like *"that's nice, dear"*. She's obviously not as invested in Crocs as myself - not unless she's heading into the back garden and steals my outdoor Crocs, of course!

Anyway, I digress...

I started wearing my Crocs again, and sure enough, the pain went away once more. Dear reader, Crocs are fucking awesome. They're:

* Cheap (you can get them for like Â£30 now)
* Hard wearing
* Comfortable
* 100% waterproof
* Doctor recommended

## Seriously, buy some Crocs!

I'm considering buying a 4th pair that I can wear outdoors. I don't mean in the garden, I mean like legit outdoor - like to work and shit.

Sure, I might get some funny looks, but do I care? Nope. They're so damned comfy, and they take all the pain away from my feet. So I'd be silly not to, right...*RIGHT*?!

If you haven't tried Crocs, please do. Especially if you have any kind of problems with your feet. They're bloody brilliant. I still can't wear them without socks though - the rubber rubs on my toe nails and I *hate* it.

If I'm going sockless, there's only 1 sandal manufacturer in the game - Birkenstocks. But that's a story for another day. ðŸ™ƒ
