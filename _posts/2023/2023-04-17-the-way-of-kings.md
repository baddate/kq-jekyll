I really can't describe how much I loved this book. I think I may have enjoyed it more than the [Mistborn series](https://kevquirk.com/the-mistborn-trilogy-book-recommendation), and that says a lot.

The story follows 3 main storylines, all of which start to converge toward the end of the book. By far the best storyline though, is that of Kaladin, a soldier who ends up a slave, but the worst kind of slave...a bridgeman.

I particularly liked the concept of the light eyes vs the dark eyes. The former being the gentry and somehow superior, purely because of the colour of their eyes. This is wonderfully arbitrary, and sadly enough, believable.

Anyway, I won't post any spoilers as I wouldn't want to ruin a fantastic book for you. But if you're a fan of Sci-fi / fantasy novels, this should definitely be on your list.
