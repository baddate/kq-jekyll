I thought I'd do something different today. The *Astrosaurs* books are technically books that I've read, but instead of reading them for my own enjoyment, I've read them to my kids at bedtime. They're a great read for kids and have kept my 2 boys hooked from the first book.

We haven't read all of them yet, but we're working our way through. So far we've read around 10 of them, but there's over 20 books in [the series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrosaurs). I particularly like the premise of the dinosaurs surviving extinction because they were incredibly advanced.

A couple of the books also tangentially refer to humans within the stories, and both times it doesn't do so in a positive way. I found this particularly hilarious (and accurate).

Anyway, if you have kids that are around 10 years of age and enjoy reading, I'd highly recommend *Astrosaurs*. Conversely, if you're a parent with younger kids, like myself, they're also a great bedtime read by mum or dad.
