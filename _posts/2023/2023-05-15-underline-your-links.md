[I've talked about this myself in the past](https://kevquirk.com/whats-in-a-font-researching-website-typography) and I wholeheartedly agree with Jatan on this. While perusing the internet I've seen links that are formatted in all kinds of ways, even ones that don't seem to be formatted at all and are, to my eye at least, completely indistinguishable from the rest of the body text.

I won't re-hash what Jatan has said in his post, but suffice to say, **please underline your links.**
