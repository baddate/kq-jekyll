I recently migrated my website away from Ghost and decided to go back to WordPress. Mainly so I didn’t have to maintain a dedicated server for the website. Problem was, I _loved_ the theme I had on my Ghost site, so I wanted to emulate the look at closely as possible.

## The Hunt {#h-the-hunt}

I didn’t really want to create a new theme from scratch, as that’s a lot of work. So I decided to start hunting for a theme that I could adapt to my needs – it’s much less work and I still get the look I want.

After a lot of hunting, I managed to find a theme called [Less, by Jared Erickson](http://jarederickson.com/less-a-free-super-minimal-wordpress-theme). The theme is distributed under the GPL license, when someone asks if they can adapt the theme in the comments, Jared says:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    Go for it, as long as you leave credit for the original theme.
  </p>

  <cite>Jared Erickson</cite>
</blockquote>

The Less theme is a great starting point. It’s designed to be minimal and slick. So I got to work making Less look and feel how I needed it to. Here are some of the features and changes I have made to the base theme:

  * Improved typography using Google Fonts.
  * Fixed colour/font issues with ul/li tags.
  * Improved header formatting.
  * Changed theme colours.
  * Better formatting of blockquotes.
  * Added published date to posts.
  * Added current year to footer.
  * Added FontAwesome support.
  * Added support for sub-menus.
  * Increased width of main container to 790px.
  * Added a 404 page.
  * Various small UI updates.

All of those changes have resulted in the site you see before you. A theme I have dubbed More or Less. I have, of course, decided to release More or Less under an open license. I went with [Creative Commons Attribution – ShareAlike 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0).

If you want to use More or Less on your WordPress site, you can [download the theme from Github](https://github.com/kevquirk/more-or-less).
