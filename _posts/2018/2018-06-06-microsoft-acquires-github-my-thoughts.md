It has been a couple of days since the [announcement](https://blog.github.com/2018-06-04-github-microsoft) was made that Microsoft acquires GitHub.

As soon as the announcement broke, [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org) (my Mastodon instance) was immediately awash with people complaining about the acquisition, stating that Microsoft would inevitably ruin GitHub.

For the most part I have stayed pretty quiet on the whole thing, but I decided to jot down some of my thoughts because hey, I only get 500 characters on Fosstodon. ?

## You Missed The Point {#h-you-missed-the-point}

Personally, I have one project that is currently hosted on both [GitHub](https://github.com/kevquirk/more-or-less) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/kevq/more-or-less). I decided to create two repositories for no other reason than having a backup. Because backups are always good, kids.

I think a lot of people are missing the point when it comes to the Github acquisition, and they’re basically spreading a lot of FUD. I don’t think the issue here is that Microsoft are going to take over GitHub then ruin in. Why would they?

As I understand it from listening to a recent [Linux Unplugged Podcast](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/125346/github-hubbub-lup-252), Microsoft have a significant vested interest in GitHub for their code.

## The Real Issue {#h-the-real-issue}

For me the real issue here is a lack of decentralisation, and I’m not talking about decentralisation of code repositories, as they were pretty much centralised between a handful of core Git tools anyway.

The decentralisation I’m talking about here is when these behemoth corporations swallow up these companies, resulting in a lack of competition, innovation, and ultimately, choice.

Whether it was Google, Microsoft or Amazon who acquired GitHub; I really don’t care, my opinion would have been the same for any of these companies.

Will Microsoft ruin GitHub? I have no idea, but I can tell you this – the acquisitions that these corporations keep making only bolster their market share, their patents, and ultimately their control.

#### That’s what really concerns me! {#h-that-s-what-really-concerns-me}

Also, I find it strange that hardly anyone is kicking up a fuss about [Electron](https://electronjs.org). Erm, it’s maintained by GitHub you know folks, and there is a shit tonne of Linux Electron apps out there. If Microsoft are going to ruin GitHub, I think the community has bigger things to worry about.

What do you guys think? Am I missing the point here too? Please feel free to leave your thoughts below.
