Congratulations on joining a secret society! RSS Club is a collection of blogs (personal and otherwise) committed to providing RSS-only content. It’s like a newsletter delivered to your feed reader in order to celebrate the medium of RSS and breakaway from social media.

I'd love to take credit for this incredible idea, but alas all that kudos goes to the most excellent [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/rss-club/).

If you didn't know already, I'm a [firm believer](/please-add-rss-support-to-your-site/) in RSS. So when I saw Dave's RSS Club, I just had to join in.

## The rules
Just like [that famous movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/) there are some rules to RSS Club, which are:

* 1st rule of RSS Club is _“Don’t Talk About RSS Club”_.
* 2nd rule of RSS Club is _“Don’t Share on Social Media”_.
* 3rd rule of RSS Club is _“Provide Value”_.

If you want to get involved too, great! Just make sure you follow the rules above.
