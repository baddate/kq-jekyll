Before you contact me, please take note of the following:

* **<mark>I don’t accept guest posts.</mark>** Sorry, this is a personal blog.
* I don't have time to provide tech support. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is great.
* Please be polite; I’ll always be polite to you.

## Email: <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>

Email is the easiest way to get in touch with me. I’ll usually respond fairly quickly, often within 24 hours.

**Please note:** This is a randomly generated email that I change regularly to prevent spam. If/when I reply to your email, that will come from my actual email address so we will be able to converse.

## The Feidverse

[I have two accounts on the Fediverse](https://kevquirk.com/fediverse-backup/), one on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/), a Mastodon instance of which I'm one of the admins, and another that's hosted via [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog).

If you want to follow me on either account (I'd diggest following on both as I post different things on each), here's the links:

* [Follow me on Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@kev) (or search for `@kev@fosstodon.org` on the Fediverse)
* [Follow me on Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/kq) (or search for `@kev@qrk.social` on the Fediverse)
