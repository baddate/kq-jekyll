Personally, [I have taken a number of steps](/category/de-googling/) to try and maintain my own privacy where possible. So I think I would be remiss if I didn&#8217;t try and do the same for those who decide they want to come and read the content that I put out on this site.

Plus, it's actually the [law within the EU](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/).

With all of the above in mind, I want to do what I can to maintain the privacy of visitors to this site wherever possible. So what do I do to help ensure your privacy is maintained?

## 1. Analytics <a name="1"></a>

**The TL;DR is that there are no Analytics on this site.**

This site is hosted with Netlify, you can [read their privacy policy here](https://www.netlify.com/privacy)

### 1.1 No Cookies <a name="1.1"></a>

No tracking cookies will be dropped on to your machine from this website, which means [there is no unique ID that I can use to identify and track you](/how-online-tracking-works).

You can also use an online tool like [Cookie Metrix](https://www.cookiemetrix.com) to see what cookies are stored on your machine when you visit my site.

_Spoiler - there are no cookies!_ ðŸ™‚

## 2. Newsletter <a name="2"></a>

I maintain a very basic newsletter where I send a monthly roundup of the posts I've published that month. If you're interested, you can [find out more here](/newsletter)

This Newsletter is managed by Buttondown Email and I disable all tracking. You can review their privacy policy [here](https://buttondown.email/privacy).

Also, every newsletter issue I send contains an unsubscribe link _that actually works_. If you click it, you **will** be unsubscribed and you **won't** receive any more newsletters from me.
