{: .tldr }
Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Kev Quirk, welcome to my little corner of the Internet. On this page you can learn a little about me, my interests and what makes me tick.

During the day I work in the Information Security industry. I'm currently a Senior Vice President at Bank of America, where I lead the Cyber Threat Operations Centre (CTOC) across Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

I have worked in the InfoSec industry for over a decade now. Prior to this I was in the British Army where I served all over the world, including Iraq and Afghanistan.

In my personal life I'm a father of two and a husband of one. All in all I'm extremely privileged and very happy.

## My hobbies & interests

Outside of work, I'm still a complete and utter nerd. I enjoy both writing and learning about privacy, open source software and web design/development. I'm also somewhat of a keyboard snob.

When I'm not sat at my keyboard, I try to keep fit by running a few times a week and walking the dog most days. I've even been known to head into the garage and lift some weights from time to time.

Iâ€™m partial to the occasional craft beer and spiced rum. Although I try not to conform with the binge drinking reputation that us Brits have.

I also have a deep love of motorbikes. I've been riding for many years and I'm am an advanced motorcyclist and member of the [IAM](https://www.iamroadsmart.com). Having ridden many motorbike over the years, from large tourers, to naked sports bikes, I currently have something completely different:

We have lots of pets in Casa del Quirk. There's two dogs, a cat and 3 (yes, THREE) fish tanks, which contain approximately 100 fish in total and easily a couple hundred shrimp.

## Colophon

OK, enough about me. Let's talk about the technicalities of how this website is put together. I've had a number of people ask me question like *"what do you use for x?"* So I hope this section will help.

### This website

This site is built with the static site generator, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The site's theme was built by hand, by little old me and is hosted on Vercel.

The font I use on this site is [Fira Sans Condensed](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/fira-sans-condensed), which is (in my opinion) a beautiful sans-serif font, created by Mozilla. For my code blocks I use [Fira Mono](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/fira-mono) and my serif text (for things like quotes) uses [Meta Serif](https://fontsfree.pro/base-web-fonts/serif/978-meta-serif-pro.html) which is a predecessor to Fira Sans.

### My newsletter

[My newsletter](/newsletter) uses [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/) at the back-end to manage sending the actual emails, as well as the subscribe/unsubscribe process.

Because both Jekyll and Buttondown use Markdown as their editing language, I can easily paste a blog post into the Buttondown interface so that I can send newsletter issues easily.

**Something missing?** If you think there's something I should add here, please [let me know](/contact/).
