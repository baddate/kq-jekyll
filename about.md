Hi there 👋 my name is Kev Quirk, welcome to my little corner of the Internet.

{: .medium }
On this page you can learn a little about me, my interests and what makes me tick.

During the day I work in the Information Security industry. I’m currently a Senior Vice President at Bank of America, where I lead a global team of analysts in the identity space.

I have worked in the InfoSec industry for over a decade now. Prior to this I was in the British Army where I served all over the world, including Iraq and Afghanistan.

In my personal life I’m a father of two and a husband of one. All in all I’m extremely privileged and very happy.

## My hobbies &amp; interests

I enjoy both writing and learning about privacy, open source software and web design/development. I’m also somewhat of a keyboard snob.

When I’m not sat at my keyboards, I try to keep fit by working out in my home gym and playing table tennis in the local league. I also walk our dogs most days for an hour or so.

I’m partial to the occasional craft beer; I love a good hoppy pale ale. Although I try not to conform with the binge drinking reputation that us Brits have. 🙃

### Motorbikes

I also have a deep love of motorbikes. I’ve been riding for many years and I’m an [advanced motorcyclist](https://www.iamroadsmart.com/). Having ridden many motorbikes over the years, from large tourers, to naked sportsbikes, I currently have something completely different:

### Watch collecting

I’ve recently started collecting watches; specifically Casio watches. I love the vintage and simplistic look of many of their watches. They just scream nostalgia to me. I also like the fact that many of their models are very cheap, so can have lots of watches, but also not worry too much about damaging them.

My favourite watch is probably the [F-91W](/the-casio-f-91w-is-the-best-smartwatch/) as I currently have 6 of them, but that may well change as my collection grows.

### Pets

We have lots of pets in Casa del Quirk. There’s 2 dogs, a cat and 4 (yes, FOUR) fish tanks, which contain approximately 150 fish and easily a few hundred shrimp.

One of my favourite times of day is during the evening when the kids are in bed, the house is quiet and I can just sit there, with a beer, watching my fish.

## Colophon

OK, enough about me. Let’s talk about the technicalities of how this website is put together. I’ve had a number of people ask me question like *“what do you use for x?”* So I hope this section will help.

### This website

This site is built upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){: target="blank" }, and I use a custom theme that I built myself.

> Why is this website so ugly?

Is it? I subscribe to the [brutalist mentality](/a-brutally-simple-site/) and I think this site is beautiful in its simplicity. There are few bells &amp; whistles, and the site is extremely content focussed.

Hosting is provided by a [Ionos](https://ionos.co.uk) VPS, running Plesk, which has an excellent WordPress hosting utility. I also have [BunnyCDN](https://bunny.net/?ref=gnn7bkvipc) sitting in front of my Ionos VPS, providing my global CDN. Again, an excellent service at a very reasonable price.

To give you an idea, this site costs me around £7/month in hosting and CDN charges.
