I've been running this website in some form since 2013 and since then this site has gone through [quite the evolution](/the-design-history-of-this-website/).

As this site gets more popular, the costs associated with keeping all the wheels turning increases. With that in mind, I thought I'd setup this simple page to allow you to contribute and help keep the lights on.

If you have found any of my content useful and want to put a pound in the tip jar, or even buy me a coffee, you can do so below.

There are both one-off and recurring payments available, all of which are managed by Ko-Fi. Recurring payments can cancelled at any time.
